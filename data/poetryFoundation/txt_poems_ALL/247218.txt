OYE MUNDO / sometimes
****!****

sometimes (
                            when the night air feels chévere! 
) when i can hear the real sound 
of el barrio
on la conga        y timbales 
coke bottles 
& garbage can tops

          when i can feel
          & reallyreally touch
          la música Latina /     africana

& the fingerpoppin' soul
emergin from tears /     sweet tears of laughter

          & i can feel
          a conglomeration of vibrations /
          heat waves
          body waves
          people waves
          of real gente
          / & i feel gooooooood

when i can taste the rare culture 
of cuchifritos        y lechón 
chitterlins      & black-eyed peas 
& corn bread

          & la pompa is open 
          & cooooooools the hot tar 
          of summer heated streets
          where children play 
          kick-the-can (

& sirens 
cannot be heard)
          / sometimes
sometimes
when the last of the ghetto poets

writes of flowers
growin in gutters        / & i know it's real
           / sometimes

sometimes /      sometimes
when i can almost hear       / being echoed back
an answer
to my ghetto cry

sometimes /        sometimes
i run up the fire escape /      not to escape
& climb on the roof
& stand on the ledge
& look down
& yell out
to the midnight world
below
above
around
within :

          OYE MUNDO Tú ERES BONITO!!!

& i forget about the junkies 
on the stoop.
