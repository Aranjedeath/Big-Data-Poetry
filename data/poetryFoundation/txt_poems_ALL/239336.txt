Words torn, unseen, unseemly, scene
some far suburb's mall lot 
Summer's theme: this year's humid
--to sweat is to know--
pen squeezed too tight yields 
ink as blood or pus 
so the phrase scraped, removed 
offending thine eye: "Outsource Bush” 
Against which, insource what? Who 
will do it? Most terrible 
predicate--high above mountains snow-capped 
even in August in-flight motion 
picture Eternal Sunshine of the 
Spotless Mind infuriates many No 
action, no funny, plot too 
dense to follow, unless (unless!) 
mind's eye gives attention First 
blackbird signals many (synecdoche) 
Bumble bee wonders am I 
his flower? One hour shopping 
& the vandal's fled--him
we'll know not, never confront 
so recall the next day 
that anger directed at complexity 
as we deplaned in Seattle 
old battle never won, never 
gonna--sit now still beside 
Dungeness River to spot quail 
hopping about this untrimmed garden 
as dog walkers circle back 
jet trails in dawn sky 
thread cloud wisps, shadows sharp 
in the mountains

                    *     *     *

I pause two poems, three
pages before book's end, first 
growl of plane's motor, sun
higher now contracts shadow, dandelion 
froth blows over cut grass 
spotted white tops of clover 
something deep purple, bell-shaped, nameless
at least to me, iamb 
what iamb, chewing endlessly until 
I realize I'll never swallow 
whatever--jays bark: first fog 
is deepest when trail ends 
at first bend in the 
river--"this in six weeks 
will all be swollen, salmon 
frantic in their competition,” men 
also--on the wire-grid doorscreen 
various bugs alight at dawn 
drawn by the interior light, 
something long with wings, something
no more than a speck
with legs, I scream, you 
scream, we all scream for
that which is unnamable, unquenchable,
inconsolable (deep in one's chest 
surrounding the heart) art is 
a mode of stalking, balk 
at any configuration, at what's 
inescapably omitted, at Monticello I
very nearly wept, to imagine 
just once the president as 
the smartest, most questioning, most 
rigorous of all, no, that's 
not it either--seeing (hand 
shielding brow) the trail ahead 
is empty, the man stops 
to unleash his dogs, mist 
rises from the river--bland 
competency distributed equally among hundreds 
begets only rebellion, what winnowing 
from the first book to 
the next, the nest, mountainside 
garden fountain, yellowlegs & killdeer 
searching the mud for tasties

                    *     *     *

Who here speaks English? Who 
hear hark loud as grackle's 
incessant laugh battle after math's 
ironic sum--economy trumps all
history where now teens cluster 
to mock tourism's earnest gape 
"It looks so small” because 
it is--Trucks evacuating quarry
beep in reverse, diner's posture 
alert awaiting omelet, sausages, toast 
behind whom the sun arises 
white light o'er Morningside Heights 
cook hollering to the cashier 
in Spanish, then English, then 
a third language I don't 
understand, cringe before that glare
until muted by cloud wisps 
monastic NY hotel room deep
within shadows--What music mocks 
its maker? The rope's tug 
as Dad shakes his beard 
lost daughter found, then sold 
into marriage--in walks Burt 
again, crossing into language, subway's 
stairs become waterfalls under Ivan 
until flooding halts commute, what 
Milton sees the deaf hear 
or knot, cashews, pretzels, honey--
roasted sesame sticks, the earth 
below flat & checkered, not 
yet autumn (dry desert heat) 
Heart races art's phases (hard 
faces) heard in place in 
pink marble plaza beyond which 
red dirt surface of Mars 
is not more barren--

                    *     *     *

                                . . . or                 .
you are being driven, along 
an unfamiliar route, through streets 
of your own former home, 
whole neighborhoods tinged with emotion, 
one still dreams of jets 
sliding into houses, apartment complexes 
gone, one millisecond of stillness
then the heat & burst 
an orange ball of flame 
explodes in the mind's eye
anxious in your hotel room's 
great raft of a bed, 
for days the networks discover 
new amateur videos, waves far 
greater than one can imagine, 
on the beach bathers not 
even thinking to run, buses 
floating through streets of debris 
Banda Aceh, this week's geography 
of the public imagination, Phuket's 
stream of tourists washed away, 
bulldozers scooping corpses, our newscaster 
alone in an empty village, 
only the battered mosque remains, 
where are the people, how 
does this outer life, apocalypse 
reported, penetrate my dreams, Three 
men on the street walking 
discussing who will reach 60 
when, the way as teens 
we spoke of 20, not 
even seeing the homeless woman 
asleep beneath the newspaper racks
at Mission & Fourth, fifth 
of bourbon warms, warns, passed 
between three beneath the bridge 
day is done, day is 
the ever-present challenge, wake 
or not, the painter Jess 
simply stays asleep, paint hardens 
even cracks o'er decades, browns 
grow muddy, greens mute, sky 
goes pale, in the midst 
of an abstract field blue 
deep blue squiggles, Don Quixote 
approaches, what is possible, seen, 
heard, emotive prosody, heart because
it impacts one's breathing, gasp
to grasp the truth of 
what is not even visible 
cannot be heard, red-haired 
setter deaf to the world 
lopes slowly, copes by smell 
residual sight, my eyes shut

                     *     *     *

Dear Krishna, it's 6:11 am 
upstairs a faucet turns briefly 
Lilly is grown now, Alan's 
hair thins at last, Melissa's 
perfect smile still shines but 
no sign of Lulu, time
erodes what's dear, what's near 
is past too soon to 
grasp fully the consequence, dawn 
threatens a new day constantly 
sun as vicious as dusk 
or rather simply uncaring, birds 
disinterested in the infant's corpse, 
it's language that introduces emotion 
or the other way round, 
my old street so narrow 
two boys throwing a football 
would find my world unimaginable 
& I'm sure theirs likewise 
will amaze them, how quaint 
that first home network seems 
already, Norma says of Barbara 
she's there and then not 
mimicking consciousness more slowly now 
so that others can see 
you feel the heat's lack 
but not the wind, wind 
up an old clock, airplane 
I realize is now tracking 
the traffic, the early commute
(first train, best train), still 
no hint of sun but 
now all the trees, houses 
visible in silhouette, the dog
audible by its collar, paws 
over hardwood, then a sigh, 
across the street windows emerge, 
porches, no longer just outlines, 
details, a larger jet now 
a few cars, then many, 
my penmanship more ornate today 
no sign of the trembles 
an instant ago I sat 
in Elliot's kitchen, then taped 
words cut from the paper 
above the dog's white bowl 
"good dog”--the last I'd 
ever live with I didn't 
know then, I dream you 
floating, not plummeting, from high 
off that bridge, birds finally 
begin to twitter, color floods 
emerging day, the sun still 
behind the hills, face west 
toward whichever future comes, mockingbird 
mimics dog collar, another bird's 
three note peep, discern now 
which jet is which, pinks 
streak the high sky, I 
rise, eyes blink shaking sleep 
away, 757 angles in fog 
bay at the runway's rim 
engines raring, waiting, ready, poised 
then flaring, to race forward 
up over the salt ponds 
half hidden in the mist, silhouette 
of the city piercing cloud
(but the bridges are hidden) 
inner ear, particular trumpet, displays 
pressure, cottony wisps soon scatter 
valleys revealed green & gold 
I hold the fluted glass 
to cleanse the palette, mango 
ice cream, or the sauce 
hot & sweet, spicy, smoked 
eggplant, rice absorbs the broth 
breath, breadth, bread, a head 
too big for hats, hands 
likewise large grasp the ball 
with ease, to please herself 
she walks on her palms 
then flips upright, smiling, sees
more than we know, teases 
younger brother, mother, dad, bad 
dogs? Never!

                     *     *     *

                                  --stone
said to contain its own 
sculpture thwarts choice--to voice 
vowels languidly moist lips purse 
their part--there's an art 
to it intuited before thought 
thinks--

                     *     *     *

paused at an intersection not 
visible from here, the blue 
of a perfect spring morning 
unimaginable above this grey crush 
of apartments, who here owns 
the slightest yard, young man 
alone in Chipotle, chewing thoughtfully 
his large burrito, not talking 
taking it all in, eyes 
absorbing all, could have been 
had this taqueria been there 
then, myself in 1964, what 
little I knew then but 
could learn by doing, earn 
just enough to eke by, barking 
for the Café Wha? dime 
for each new customer I 
lacked the huckster's flair lone 
feather by a gravel road 
all one needs by wch 
to fabricate the tale, each 
to each not beach exactly
but stones against the water 
piled up to the dock 
beyond which (or wch) mockingbird 
hops to confront a robin 
squirrel rears up to eat 
some morsel in the clover, 
each page would blow wild 
but for the binding stitched 
deep into the notebook's spine

                    *     *     *

                                 . . . how 
many words have I left, 
use them wisely, sparingly, each 
could outlast me, to what 
purpose but this compulsive record 
forward from the age of 
a small midcentury lad, sitting 
cross-legged on my bed, scribbling 
anything to be free, anything
 to make sense--peel cellophane 
from a new tea carton 
no indication where it's grown 
(Argentina!) no record no ___ 
sense of the map, Heywood 
called his first book Cartographers 
was there ever a second--
a sense now, over half 
a century intricate puzzle 
grandmother reduced to ash grandfather 
no more silent than ever 
just for being dead, sip 
today's first tea, the warmth
is the half of it 
my throat first craves, table 
narrow in the kitchen alcover 
West Virginia a-frame cabin, clock
with a different bird song
for every hour, sans kids 
what have you to etch 
these words into time, applause
once we crossed the border
my 47th state, family myths
arc over generations, John Franklin
Tansley could not have known 
telling any who would listen
that yes the explorer yes
his own grandfather yes but
the grandson Richard goes back
a century later, looks up 
finds the marriage record yes
John Franklin yes married Jane
but instead a fishmonger 
married a weaver's daughter x 
marks the signature, how soon 
technology catches you out
these keys enact a surveillance 
that will only sink deeper
over time, what you sink 
'bout that, from comma to 
coma to commerce to con
versus sub jugation the root 
marks language's route across form
surname in the family now 
just four generations, but literacy
not more than six, so what 
arrogance am I then enacting 
weaving ink into paper, stains 
of a history already blanching 
in the light, up above
I hear you stirring, rising
at least to sit up 
then slowly, quietly coming downstairs
to use the bathroom, dawn
just starts to be visible 
through the blinds, soft glow
neither blue nor gray, sun
not yet visible, they're distinct
sun & the dawn, one 
recurs while the other stretches
fans swirl slowly high overhead 
but the windchime is still

                    *     *     *

Why repair rotting kitchen now? 
Why seek, read every book 
if the flood won't quit 
even when you've left, Desire 
Desire is the answer, hunger 
never rests, geese each dawn 
now for decades circling lake 
until day's form is found
all over again, I rise 
to write, sun still hidden 
behind hills, hummingbird upon branch 
appears so still, breathe deep 
to taste air, first bart, 
first bark, squirrel's tail twitches 
causing whole branch to shake 
train's whistle deep & steady 
three echoes distinct, great shushing 
rush of traffic, white noise 
forms morning music, outside window
spider quick on his thread 
it's all about scale, bicycle's 
brakes squeal long way down
Stands on her deck naked 
to inspect the day, trumpet flower 
pod yellow, almost purple tip 
phallic before it explodes, 
red, red-orange, bright yellow center 
notebook's pages dwindle, one project 
I'll not complete, that's not 
it's point, but to stretch
even just a little, shape 
& dimension, time & dominion, 
day's echoes ricochet up hill 
canyon to canyon, every fold 
marvelous instrument my declining ear 
hears what I cannot see, 
say, sheer ecstasy of breath
each one, no two alike 
ever, audible in head's bell
sinus sounds, own teeth grinding
until jaw's muscles spasm, clench

                     *     *     *

                        Dear Los 
Angeles Dodgers, my bête noir 
not, you form the surrogate 
we so desperately need, enemy 
enema, it all comes out
in the wash, one road 
south of Dogtown, garden fenced 
to ward off deer, plums 
their skin tart, their flesh 
sweet & cool, I almost 
don't recognize the hummingbird, still 
on the almond branch, farms 
here feel vast, we missed 
a single turn, Bob speaks 
of how o becomes d 
or vice versa, Steve talks 
happily of new son, David
& I & ours eat 
around a front yard table 
just behind a small picket fence
the heat rare even here
you never see birds sleep 
hummingbird's red crown, white chest 
a view of the bay 
from the deck, audible neighbors
not really visible, someone's alarm 
reaches endless reiteration, arise, arise 
your eyes must be clear 
the sound of bart different
from day of my youth 
thin haze but no fog 
light spreads over San Francisco
clouds at first seem small 
until one speck of plane 
flies beneath, then a second 
absolutely crosswise, big truck's sticker 
reads "Give War a Chance” 
Look for the gun rack 
boats sit still in bay 
who works there in silence 
only because I'm too far 
to hear, notebook reaches limit 
not unlike mind or heart 
whole family singing Beatles songs
as we drive, first thought
not your own, let alone
best, phrases weave against lines 
water comes to a boil 
squirrels wrestle in the branches
one skitters across the slanted roof 
Mount Tam silent as ever 
only seems unchanging (human scale)
clouds above have moved on 
leaving new sky, sun muted 
still amid trees, I close 
my eyes just to listen 
laughing jay, distant train, feel
instead air over hair, back
of my hand, its taste 
palpable in nostrils, eucalyptus, tea 
hummingbird responds to jay, jets 
echo heading east, sounds create 
(first sprinkler, bottle on table) 
sense of my own body 
high in the Berkeley hills
