In Another Room I Am Drinking Eggs from a Boot

Hans Richter
What if the moon was essence of quinine 
And high heels were a time of day 
When certain birds bled 
The chauffeur is telling the cook 
The antler would pry into ice floes 
Swim with a lamp 
And we'd be shivering in a ditch 
Biting through a black wing 
There would be boats 
There would be a dream country 
The great quiet humming of the soul at night 
The only sound is a shovel 
Clearing a place for a mailbox
