The Canticle of Jack Kerouac

1. 

Far from the sea far from the sea 
                                     of Breton fishermen 
       the white clouds scudding 
                                             over Lowell 
            and the white birches the 
                                           bare white birches   
                along the blear night roads 
                                       flashing by in darkness   
            (where once he rode 
                                        in Pop's old Plymouth)   
And the birch-white face 
                                    of a Merrimac madonna   
            shadowed in streetlight 
                            by Merrimac's shroudy waters   
                  --a leaf blown 
                                     upon sea wind 
                     out of Brittany 
                                           over endless oceans 


2. 

There is a garden in the memory of America 
There is a nightbird in its memory 
There is an andante cantabile 
in a garden in the memory   
of America 
In a secret garden 
in a private place 
a song a melody 
a nightsong echoing 
in the memory of America   
In the sound of a nightbird   
outside a Lowell window 
In the cry of kids 
in tenement yards at night 
In the deep sound 
of a woman murmuring 
a woman singing broken melody 
in a shuttered room 
in an old wood house 
in Lowell 
As the world cracks by 
                                 thundering 
like a lost lumber truck 
                                    on a steep grade   
               in Kerouac America 
The woman sits silent now 
                                     rocking backward   
      to Whistler's Mother in Lowell 
                         and all the tough old 
                                          Canuck mothers   
                              and Jack's Mémère 
And they continue rocking 

      And may still on stormy nights show through   
          as a phantom after-image 
                            on silent TV screens   
             a flickered after-image 
                              that will not go away   
                in Moody Street 
                  in Beaulieu Street 
                   in ‘dirtstreet Sarah Avenue'   
    in Pawtucketville 
       And in the Church of St. Jean Baptiste 


3. 

And the Old Worthen Bar 
                                  in Lowell Mass. at midnight   
         in the now of Nineteen Eighty-seven 
Kerouackian revellers 
                               crowd the wood booths 
         ancient with carved initials 
                  of a million drinking bouts 
                        the clouts of the 
                                       Shrouded Stranger 
                  upon each wood pew 
      where the likes of Kerouack lumberjack 
             feinted their defiance 
                                 of dung and death 
Ah the broken wood and the punka fans still turning   
          (pull-cord wavings 
                                     of the breath of the Buddha)   
       still lost in Lowell's 
                                        ‘vast tragedies of darkness' 
                           with Jack 


4. 

And the Four Sisters Diner   
         also known as ‘The Owl'   
Sunday morning now 
                           March Eighty-seven 
or any year of Sunday specials   
Scrambled eggs and chopped ham 
   the bright booths loaded with families 
      Lowell Greek and Gaspé French 
               Joual patois and Argos argot 
    Spartan slaves escaped 
                         into the New World 
         here incarnate 
                              in rush of blood of 
                            American Sunday morning 
And "Ti-Jean” Jack Kerouac   
      comes smiling in 
                           baseball cap cocked up 
               hungry for mass 
                              in this Church of All Hungry Saints   
         haunt of all-night Owls 
                                           blessing every booth ... 


5. 
Ah he the Silent Smiler 
    the one 
               with the lumberjack shirt 
         and cap with flaps askew 
                     blowing his hands in winter 
             as if to light a flame 
    The Shrouded Stranger knew him 
         as Ti-Jean the Smiler 
            grooking past redbrick mill buildings 
            down by the riverrun 
                              (O mighty Merrimac 
                                           ‘thunderous husher') 
               where once upon a midnight then 
            young Ti-Jean danced with Mémère 
                   in the moondrowned light 
And rolled upon the greensward   
    his mother and lover 
         all one with Buddha 
                           in his arms 


6. 

And then Ti-Jean Jack with Joual tongue 
      disguised as an American fullback in plaid shirt   
          crossing and recrossing America 
                                             in speedy cars   
    a Dr. Sax's shadow shadowing him 
      like a shroudy cloud over the landscape   
       Song of the Open Road sung drunken 
               with Whitman and Jack London and Thomas Wolfe 
            still echoing through 
                            a Nineteen Thirties America   
                            A Nineteen Forties America   
                            an America now long gone 
               except in broken down dusty old 
                                              Greyhound Bus stations 
                   in small lost towns 
       Ti-Jean's vision of America 
                seen from a moving car window 
                      the same as Wolfe's lonely 
                                                sweeping vision 
                  glimpsed from a coach-train long ago 
       (‘And thus did he see first the dark land')   
And so Jack 
                in an angel midnight bar 
   somewhere West of Middle America 
          where one drunk madonna 
                        (shades of one on a Merrimac corner)   
      makes him a gesture with her eyes 
                                                       a blue gesture   
          and Ti-Jean answers 
                                       only with his eyes   
And the night goes on with them 
       And the light comes up on them 
                      making love in a parking lot 


7. 

In the dark of his fellaheen night 
    in the light of the illuminated 
                                 Stations of the Cross 
               and the illuminated Grotto 
                           down behind the Funeral Home   
                                           by roar of river   
       where now Ti-Jean alone 
                     (returned to Lowell 
                        in one more doomed 
                                    Wolfian attempt 
                                    to Go Home Again)   
    gropes past the Twelve Stations of the Cross 
               reciting aloud the French inscriptions 
                   in his Joual accent 
            which makes the plaster French Christ 
                                                       laugh and cry 
                  as He hefts His huge Cross 
                                        up the Eternal Hill   
    And a very real tear drops 
                                           in the Grotto 
                           from the face 
                                              of the stoned Virgin 


8. 

         Light upon light   
The Mountain 
                  keeps still 


9. 

         Hands over ears   
He steals away 
               with the Bell. . . . 


Writ in Lowell and Conway and Boston Mass. and San Francisco   
March-April 1987
