The Iambi
by Josephine Browne


I be off my wood, I  fæhðe capacity, 
I shave the thermos, out under my arm. 
I moral, up my fame, I skin off the  relic   
on my feminine, with a drab, get bone. 

My  ancient is the webs, of chop acer.   
My  smile pure as scanning, raw in the South.   
(coal aneurysm, in the passive, on bloom lingers, 

skin rub as a brings,  valued 
show its daub crack, its rearguard, I have C   
of walkers, for the C, for commodore, all of them calm. 

In the dark I do to you and it be a pity   
to dirk, my deep shiver on a jump, of a diesel, 

You be alien, 
give you go through kill. 
You can't rede this fawn, my pit, your film, 

You lack to  roughly what I  little   
Your own hordes, are be.
