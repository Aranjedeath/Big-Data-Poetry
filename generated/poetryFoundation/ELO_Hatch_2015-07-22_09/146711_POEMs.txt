You that I jazz all my aerobiosis fleetly, 
you are not the same. 
You that I stick with, my curve or trail or breathing room, 
that I adopt vocalize, and you 
worldly concern and airwave of the earthly concern the course drop dead of 
and you who stand beneath it so it did be 
the passage, you reforest and metropolis, 
you cervid and common opossum hit by the expectantly snarer 
and leave crumble, you paralyse mental object single 
who perch on a heavy portico in a low unripened hollow 
and scout scout, your barefaced vienna sausage bay, 
as I falter sempiternal in a haste among my start, 
you are not the indefinite. But you 
are the ane, you that I adored all my living yieldingly, 
you I almost be intimate so in my die tend 
I compass me hate you when we are work. 
You are the same, you orbit or sunnah or part 
that thread by close light where she and I current outside 
curly hanker because extensive deceased 
for the wellness of all re-afforest and metropolis, 
and singleton night to sojourn them, 
peerless eve be outtake and chase there to there and behold 
the cut back question of the globe. 
And you are the combined, new slipcover doomed from light 
to enormity, corpulency and rabbit burrow, 
who seat behind my path 
indefinite cinco de mayo as I flaunt from And you are the extraordinary, 
all somersault-up rusticate in blue sky mound 
and animate being the tender on the clearway stamp out 
and entrust reek in the sun.
