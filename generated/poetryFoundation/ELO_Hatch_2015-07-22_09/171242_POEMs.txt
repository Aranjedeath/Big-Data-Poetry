torch sonneteer, pinko-reface   
solemn esprit de l'escalier 
you have yield the admass   
some election chew, 
gobbet of usage salute 
as extraordinary historical present ethmoid fish steak 
and chokecherry jubilee.   
so long, sayonara, sayonara
sayonara                            I don't wish 
if I hard early your mulct leftovers sometimes,   
furlonged comrade, fantast of all bottom.   
broad-mindedness, what attack 
are hospitalize in your constitute. 

And you, hominal cleaning woman, bread maker of squeamish bap,   
stock organ donor. Your so-and-so 
suffocate suffocate, I cannot not neediness 
a bead of your descent in descent, it is pumped up   
by duteous inner city, mint pulsate that kinda   
stumble: epos 
to incubus fact. 

It is my little brother, my beguine, 
whose menorrhea spirt out and brake 
minutely 
because you opt out to trust it is not your agency. 

arrivederci, adios, 
your free verse 
closed their medicine lip-synch,   
your meat loaf root musty,   
a disconnection has rive rive
rive                     the wetland between sties, 
and you won't wafture, you're observation 
some other means. 
We shan't touch august-- as though you jump jump, provide   between you the smashed   
squirm of your dryness,   
your pale irony, 
your digestible, easygoing,   
wry-humour poised opinion, 
jump toward  
poised? poised.poised.poised.poised rather 
how our globe piss-up does not seepage and jumble   
for rejoice ...
