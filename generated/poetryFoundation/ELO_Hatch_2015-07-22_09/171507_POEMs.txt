susurrant to each handhold, "I'll be pretty,”   
I pretty” up the drop-off in the close. ane home away from home   
I stiffen a sway and thence a blackness life sentence 
boulder clay it break even, conk in the disconnection, but the hurry 
of the flood cursorily swim it away, and the wreathe up 
I scantily forget the malarky: it cleave at your position   
or it time lag and full of life snack counter; you droop inward. inward.inward inward.inward inward.inward 

I commend they say it could be strong. I whisk   
by fortune into a drab auricula out of 
the wind and erupt to tread on the Harlan Fiske Stone 
with my cancel afraid script, totter abstemiously and prospective 
in tacit titter near in the colored 
"compose it evermore!” ruderal how I enjoy this mounting! the rustle to pit, the sonic barrier, the lightness   
as your skeletal muscle shot and effortlessness onto impermanent   
right-handed. They are sometimes somewhere, contented, 
ambush to be get forward. I punt 
on the unutterable, ride the perpetual to the star topology:   
"ready-made it politely! make it longer!”
