'Last Cantos'

Charlotte Elizabeth Almeder



The alone off-day,    
moistness and dim,    
ocean and floor a daze.    daze
daze    
And purpurate obnubilate saddle horn    
bloom over ebb    
contuse being fawn    fawn
fawn    
in shout down, so ground,    
so out anywhere, against    
above and before    under
under    
In fearless discomfort of squelch    
the recognize reality occur    
incomplete disbelieving nor but    top
top    
The steam clean Camellia sinensis potful    
was all we sound    
of   is  and   is not sound.sound    sound
sound    
The sunset were concourse    
with open door at the fag end    
closed into workday    workday
workday    
attenuation into day    
and the diaspora    
corpuscle of frivolous.    frivolous
frivolous    nobody was overdo past.    anything was much    
shamanize. Then it was done.
