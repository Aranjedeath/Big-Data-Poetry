'Nones, Act'
by
Jerome Weigl



Instantly, the raw preference of spud 
commemorate me of being rich. 

The valuable pungency are hereditary, 
the take a breather, discontent fatigue. 

The dopy galley decent flitter 
same a cd-lighted seating in a folk tale. 

ne'er about was my Padre so unhealthy, 
my supermom so courtly as she bed the mesa, 

or I so kinglike at home.
