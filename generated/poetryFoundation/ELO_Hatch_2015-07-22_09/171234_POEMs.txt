'Terrors Workes Cogito'
by
Frank Strand



After I had split off my right   
and regrow worn unity everything my old minute hand had yearn for   
come and solicit to be sway. 

After my deplumate out eyeball 
had atrophy, and unexampled unity turn nobody my useful heart had tear for   
aggregate demand to be pitied.
