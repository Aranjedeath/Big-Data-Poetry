I think I was outgrow wing case 
it was a cocoon. 

I think, now is the fourth dimension to stride   
into the fusillade 
it was rich hush. 

eschatology is a dogmatize I read 
as a baby: the major of heavy least; 

confront my hand glass retentive Sung, Sung
Sung       the stop press-incapacitated of last, last
last       the click-ascend from slumber and hue and cry   hue and cry
hue and cry            and wrawl, tremendous, 

however 
I catch sight for a second   
that's not second: it is   
the number 8 security blanket. 

Logos after countersign 
drift through the Methedrine.   per me.
