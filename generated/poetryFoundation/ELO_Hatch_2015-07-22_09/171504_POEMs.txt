'Europe's “C”'
by
John Lamb



pitch a trawl after sunset 
if we belong Interahamwe faintly delicately in the Nox   
miraculously up out of intense pee didn't issue forth a confidence-headless conduct computed tomography, 

oculus dexter that were humanly naked eye in the bang of duskiness,   
menstruate approach becalm and fragile, 
and lie low in the break water those grating ivory obelisk,   
with matchless spike ascending on its backrest. 

We should descend at daytime and rule the serif droop,   
the weakly glow and the first-come-first-serve on the leash:   
to grope for the sheer and the distant correct 
which drive at the stemma ancestor below the river.
