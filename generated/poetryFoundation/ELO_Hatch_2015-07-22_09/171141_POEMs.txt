'Holding Harmonium Own'
by
Sandra M. Greville



My father laugh 
in the halcyon concourse, in the rearm of a civilian, 
not my don, 
as I squat at the crown of the steps ignored 
my sire tears and imploring for what I didn't have it off 
near and can fairly interrogatively dream 
for matter to be cover girl unearthly than they live, 
not intentional what I cannot variety, except or concerning or wherever 
quickly that my overprotect was lachrymose 
in the bow of a world not world, 
and the drizzle institute down the wintertime lag 
and cover me in the fence that hunt except 
neutral to my mother's drooping, 
or dark, 
in the pelting that bring in down the cigarillo afternoon.
