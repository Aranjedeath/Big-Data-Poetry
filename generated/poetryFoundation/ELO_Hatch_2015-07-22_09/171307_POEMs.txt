'So York The Defence'
by
Nick  Bethanis



My fuss-opt out the familiar to the domesticize: 
Dove-iou, civic compensate, brocket coprolite, 
Frog's constantly dilate with euphony imperfect, 
Leaf-model frontier, Campanula rotundifolia, mushroom, 
uneven, tropical snake in the grass wandering through the remember, 
gold carpenter's mallet jog over I. F. Stone: all 
rampantly and wæs!-winkle out her irritable get off, and widely, she   
find fault up the dart, crock squash racket the CT set at her foot,   
And harbour the euphony revulsion to the speculum, where 
He stargaze on himself, and pipe similar a previous concealment room access right until 

bet from her material hitch, each offstage 
fall brattle down please a sceðþan inglorious deadlight. 
standing unagitated, she begin, "It's Shangri-la ground pine ...” 
The dote pussyfoot fuselage, the barbell dig peek 
In the catch eyeball. Then we ascertain, 
And backfire: dirt ball, sick, abbreviated, 
cuddle with the flight-pockmark, softly nurse and drowse.   
The pacifier lay out from her helping hand, and with its thump, 
Swiftly, the honk, with an especial ghastly oral cavity 
close up on the pollute webbing, rumble, take them out to the back out condescend. 

But so, obscure profligate, a subjective pool on the level   
be, of all my mother's buyout bid, twist necrophilia   
For a precipitous tame, lose, pose, and mysterious living   unlike its hideaway and warren, its screwball endocarp,   
Whose plainsman can crank over the earth   
With ptyalize clapper, a rancidness, talon, tenterhook,   
To stick or grease benefaction, foreign 
As our clunky gob, our ergodic spread out of shoot.   
She sweep to the kitchenette. sour on the spigot,   
She moisten and elute the feel for from her minute hand.
