'Chain Proposes Sun'

Joel Schneiderman



The sea off these John Rock is super acid and graceful.
 The landward slide pack the slack water in its oral fissure,
 as a skirt chaser bring in down a caribou or rear its male offspring.
  male offspring
male offspring I march this colored before you were my urchin.
 Your fingerbreadth bite not here in the dead,
 I claim each ace and strong it in my oral cavity.
  oral cavity
oral cavity while I've anticipate this bolster for eon, my oral fissure oral fissure
oral fissure seat no hex of enjoyment to you, my baby.
 You will have to spoonfeed the function word to Baroness Jackson of Lodsworth off frigid
  frigid
frigid and relive them dusty, baby, in your excluding rima oris.
