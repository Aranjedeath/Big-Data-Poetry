light and halal and vagabond,   vagabond
vagabond    they at last gouge 
their pig from the stand up. stand up
stand up    I have been their sorting. 

date by our unstuff understructure   understructure
understructure    the intense, mast bentonite, 
take heed and adhere and strong   strong
strong    as baby clay sculpture at run 
or as the the opera designed   designed
designed    before He take a breather it hint. 
The world we jab and run run
run    for inflorescence, is beorhtan in rest.

keel over    territory, handmaiden and dim-witted,   
where all our dispatch putrescence, putrescence
putrescence    where our young sudden infant death syndrome irreversible

get hold of    immoderate from you, narrow and dumb,   since I have congeal my calamus   calamus
