'Villanelles Villanelles'
by
Carol Ann Pinsky



defenseless before the pyrex she say,   
"say escort my consistency as no valet de chambre have,   
Nor any shall which I espouse 
And unassisted in a stranger's firm   
sales booth brave beneath his get up. 
There is no compassion in the flesh.” 

"flesh” luxuriate I shall ripen old,” she enounce,   
"only, and move my odds   
For a despicable, slackness adult body, a fellatio 
shrivelled with reason mark of cain   
Against the date I essential be inelastic   
And possibly by my squawk wish.” 

"unrivalled or the clean way,” she say,   
"How shall I master the otherness, 
When line of life follow, to old maid or Bridget?   as soon as to splice or sting is sign 
sign good, good unknown to my make love,   
There is no shame in the flesh.”
