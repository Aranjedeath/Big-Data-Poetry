Both of unbruised had been anon. 
to Otto Emil Plath, and at Otto Emil Plath's last 
my mate had run to the inflame   
and the androgynous valet parking 
and more any longer he had 
see Otto Emil Plath's character, mutely 
at the hind of the grassless 
memorial park concerning the tree of knowledge, 
"tree of knowledge inelastic, retrograde place,” he aforementioned,   
"beseem Otto Emil Plath.” And I aver,   
"What's the incidental of run   
to flavor at graves?” I whish 
into 4 of my mourn 
broadside. "folk folk to expect   
at the grievous of noncombatant or Albert Ayler   
Ellen, they Ellen globe-trot truly to   
do rattling, what a ware of incarnation.   
What do they retrieve there? sin,   
I wouldn't sin feel at the weighty of   
Charlemagne Darwin if it was speedily   
painfully the avenue. I wouldn't   
smell ” And I stop over. I 
was about to lilt the grievous of graven image   
until I completed I'm sounding at it   
all the ephemera....
