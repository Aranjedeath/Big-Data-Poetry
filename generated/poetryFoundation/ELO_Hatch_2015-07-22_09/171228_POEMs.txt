'energia labio de Fable'
by
Robert Penn Brown



From the chromatic slug 
from the showery Nox 
from the resource catch 
itself and more than itself 
anywhere and more than only 
at the tush of the fountainhead where the daydream reside,   
can you draw me 

into Dec? an upland 
of terreplein, touch of infinite 
eminent of penumbra of swarm squander from 
cosmic dust over cosmic dust
cosmic dust                  fresh mill, late successful 
under nice December stride? the fast 
right smart to loaded? 

The blemished lunation 
act as on the falsity, and channelize   
an fall of idle 
speechlessness. 
You experience, but scantily anywhere, 
your front equal others, telephone by band, 
and transfer. Did you believe   
I does not transform? transform
transform
transform                              The right daydream 
evert invariably, its warm up through. A tenderheartedness, 
wordless fall.   
We are wildfire 
really to the resource. What the 
vision vision
vision             commandeer 
as smasher essential be falsity. What tentacle you 
to what you realise of me is 
that grasp alone.
