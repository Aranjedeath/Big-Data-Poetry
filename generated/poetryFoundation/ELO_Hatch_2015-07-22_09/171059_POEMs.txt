close the windowpane and you deprivation to alert verboten, 
convincingly you itchy feet here 

I hold I appreciate you, near prodigally on the berm, 
where I've provide you. 

How rive-arouse and smooth 
can combined spirit spirit? 

Again I think, It will terminate. 
Again I read and cling. 

I watch there that   
to hang was in my animality. 

I plan I idealize you, as if you wink 
already through the deadlight. 

I feel I catch you, now when I sopor. 

think back this as a bolero, 
a jammed flare 

both the dwarf tulip corner   
glow in bill efflorescence 

and the sob silvery birch.
