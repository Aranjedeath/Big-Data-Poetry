'ghastly Journal Dead Water'

She had twist her dial up into 
a drizzle of dismantle, and come on twinkly. 

The happy filter down her brow   
and into her compound eye. It run down 

into the cervix of her metaphor 
and squirt the black halter of her boob. 

Her browned place splatter on 
into the faint. The here and now was same 

a carnival black Maria revolve before her 
through wee-wee of light up, a hutch on wheel around, 

and she stagger tight behind bum,   
clayey, terminal, press her malacca 

through the interception, pound and nudge,   
while the admass creep plump for in a nook.
