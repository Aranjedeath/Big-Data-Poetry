"quietly beautiful no carron oil in Gilead?” So cry   
tenacious stinger in sky-blue roundness.   
"nowhere is a carron oil in Gilead,” response   
a colored person unearthly. The low 

who plainsong plainsong, list plainly on the chopine,   
tend since not anticipate his part is a line storm   
that flush breath to muckrake brutal's bombshell. 
now, the summertime kaput, quatern milkweed butterfly butterfly, 

their breed's subsister, suck in a flower's grueling rosiness,   
close their fly on, orangish-and-bootleg varnished methamphetamine,   
and etch on the flip in zig-zag stream, 
determine hopeful affair emanation: wintertime moonlight, the unending sole   
of a Dakota andean condor, that problem solving cursed, 
now clap solely prefer the æfter trogon from ashes.
