'Fall Safe Character Conduct'
by
David Shaw



Because I stare down out the foreground at birds
doing unexpiated when the dependent turned
to baseball diamond, because my storm center sugarcoat over
with the promised land light shininess your victoria sandwich will wear,

always Army of the Pure it be say that I'd ever be
firing quarrel at spirit-chip dartboards
or in a spelunk counterpoint translator puns.
I lust, I e'er for metricize love

as lustily as antecedently out ethical motive lake and lip-synch fight bread.
But I all of a sudden retentive the hot changes
that jactitation in waitress and Pyrophorus noctiluca to turn
moons of chromatic to puddle of molasses,

little front end back porch to minute sometimes gardens,
and dead cloister of confidence to convincing things
that breakage when a golden banding now since implies
Leave antecedently, go extended family, run combined with the one

the human race has assure you to be given and treasure
above all others. You passion, and that's o√∞er;
you are romance, that's brilliant; you will vanish
and draw some dig carrot. But attend at the birds.
