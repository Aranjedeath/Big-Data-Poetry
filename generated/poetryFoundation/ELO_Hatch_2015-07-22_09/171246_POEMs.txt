for fingers
We smirk at each shaping 
and I list fortunately against the caning cast.   
How does it suffocate to be golden? I vocalize. 
You reach my genu with your o'er middle finger.   
And when you close your cytostome, 
a bolus of majestic jinx surrender to the knock down   
and cut a leak through leak. 
Don't contradistinguish contradistinguish, I pronounce. I don't need to pick up.   
Did you catch, you bulge, 
bluing a dazzle genial of sarcenet decorate 
and Hell by shipwreck, 
so stubborn you relieve caveat caveat,   
your ring finger browse that ao dai 
and you autopsy the well-grounded of a barong press clipping composition,   
you see it too 
and you agnise how that persona 
is sure as shooting the denotation of some other scarecrow,   
that your own animation 
is a range of mountains of countersign 
that combined date will press stud. 
bust-up, you allege, brunet son in a disk, personal property script,   
and activation to mutiny psaumes 
in their verification poultice, 
corresponding þære atomic number 8 reflate, 
the lei of bloom on their head up centrifuge, 
and above all which 
that's where I'm unfixed,   
and that's what it's care for 
beautiful x multiplication decipherable, 
00 moment more ugly.   will not someone hostile futile futile?
