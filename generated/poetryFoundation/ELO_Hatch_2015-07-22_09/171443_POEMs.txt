I am no sheepman of a child's suspect. 
I have read dread where the wound snake lift, 

lust where the stag fire up wag day lily- English hawthorn 
And welted thistle, mustard seed, and the uncivilised oat check. 

There is all in in this bare. I realize in the torridity 
creme de menthe interfering in the thrash straw. 

So to this minute. Through the quick gloam I drive 
To rash winnowing on the fizzle charcoal burner, 

And find no imago of glowering wouldn't 
But care, commons, emptiness, and this comely chill.
