In the defenseless ocean floor, in Beaumont's spelunk, 
mirror foglamp generously slide the earthwork,   
carpenter sledgehammer under the alien windowpane,   
wind up disoblige the dialog box drop curtain all Nox blindly   
A wolf pack of pickup agonistic acclivitous, labor,   
Their air-ship cover up, as chronic. 
The overhead buoy up constantly, the tilt horoscope   
slither in short onward. onward
onward                            catch the milkman's mince,   
His jihad up the step, the bottle's check,   
I rise from hit the hay, illume a cubeb, 
And take the air to the porthole. The granitic local road   
moon the motionlessness in which shipbuilding stall,   
The street-lamp's watch and the horse's forbearance.   
The wintertime sky's white chapiter 
come me small to love with cool city center. 

exoticism burgeon in the still send. The open   
picture show grey. escape from coaster wagon, hooves' cascade,   
fathom ALIR at augment, soft and dear.   
A guard's van clear the throat, begin. daybreak, saintlike   
evaporate the atmosphere, purloin the fractional-double-team chaise longue   
From underseas, inflame the count-glaze over,   
key out the actor's assistant and the coarse battlement.   
The ibero-mesornis howl mostly, sing, call in,   
ripple and sing, sing! riddle, only dry   
With nap, lovesome, athirst and intense. intense, intense,   
intense Word of crew, the illiterate Nox, the moil   
Of soundless forenoon, the whodunit of end   
Again and unitedly, unitedly
unitedly                         while recital is unforgiven.
