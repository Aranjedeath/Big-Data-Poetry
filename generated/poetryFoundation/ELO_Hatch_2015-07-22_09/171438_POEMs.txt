end to droop unlike 
The squall that bluster from the counteract elm,   elm
elm      I suffocate the He'﻿﻿﻿s bollock pulverization, pulverization
pulverization
pulverization      The wander I adhere to prolong   
And lease me towering and centrifuge down into whate'er, centrifuge
centrifuge      unhook and minuscule thine thine
thine
thine      Where the square up insolate glint 
veer ordinarily from all 1 position, out of chromatic   chromatic
chromatic      And lunar year of fulgurant labour, labour
labour
labour      To homestead at þæt over man 
Who track with mightiness sawmill a puritanical pureness pureness
pureness      And, masticate weak baccy, baccy

bypass household-sorted city block and thong them to cable system   cable system
cable system      And station them chopper chopper

Into the pile and nude of politics build up,   build up

Stephanie Graf      I wax my repository and procession 
Slowly and already from the ovalbumin-gloveless man   man
man      about the rough-hew pitch pitch

Sadly, sneak through time's abacinate ply   ply

warble believe in was in all heavy metal of sea   sea
sea      Is gravely rousing, rousing
rousing
rousing      amazed to be a backer, 
To be heat in Lone-Star State by the pleasant fencing   fencing
fencing      Of homo with 10-gross ton cylinder block cylinder block
cylinder block
cylinder block      But no more storm than I 
To heart poignance night off as as much as I myself   though
though      Were well up from chromatic chromatic
chromatic
chromatic      contain by a train of thought in midair, 
Badly edit out, general-squint, and emotional uninventive,   uninventive
uninventive      Not a summon masterwork
masterwork
masterwork      Or already dwell run into at all 
But the spirit of this localise mostly the elamite,   elamite
elamite      feel emotional as joy.
