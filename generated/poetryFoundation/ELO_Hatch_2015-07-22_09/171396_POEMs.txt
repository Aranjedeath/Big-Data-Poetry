'A Walls Stand Place Not Firehead'

beauteousness 
The previous vigil: their 
thin eyeball 
quilt and save by the synodic month. The rich, point   
drag by the headwater of v neck, 
in concert, 
in the underwrite they shall be body. 

In the eastern narrow-mouthed toad pool 
the steam shack of a Sauk torpedo crawl, 

I take heed its plodder, waft, bell-like call up   
in spick-and-span oxygen. oxygen
oxygen
oxygen         oxygen 
And I incline, 
come over the mound, Africa intonation, 
her gilded Christmas carol I catch: 
crack up of deputies' ransack practice their get on isolated cad at Nox,   
sput of cattleprod, 
cattleprod go away on about the get a noseful of the sweetness mass, 
curse word of the jawan as he atropine, burning, pestle, and prod   
the Elmer Reizenstein of the humanity, 
with off-line read, yell forbidding, unproblematic scourge. scourge
scourge
scourge         scourge 
And by rice paddy in Africa 
cram 
have on a few dwarf 
shamble down a malicious gossip line, boom   
horseleech on their bounder, wise to   
whitened shoot down in the sunburst   
newfoundland shall indulge 
and break splurge into the atmosphere 
shall be get by wildfowl, 
berm vane unruffled, overlooked by previous fledge-pore,   
contractor memories 
by pliable, hamper err of the rake,   
optic rumple slam at formal eyesight   
the drifting Lord's Day that throw  jugular our lives.
