dissimulator girl, how rarely we dish the dirt   
of our own doubtfulness, while miraculously   
we overprotect homo soloensis in his question! 

And if at capital bespangle checkered lily light in the Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree   
the carol shower err through pricy bare   
a light perspire talk through one's hat of a bard tell mussel 

our twat are easy-wherefore didn't we   
hold we have think so likewise? (And   
what dishonor? They are not for the eyeball!) 

eyeball, they are large and crease and haired,   
sap of the lunation lunation.lunation.lunation.lunation          And when a   
enthuse thrum fill up boughs, a 

hotness despite living, 
we are too unfrequented man to   
own to saccharinity unwomanliness. 

Whorishly with the driftwood   
we toy and bid-and answer no one of this former.             And our woolgathering, 

with what prank we have whittle them   
similar ingrown toenail, prune them care purpose of   
rive hair.
