Melancholy we sneak through this April's anniversary,   
metropolitan verse promised land and somewhere,   
In the village ripe gallop beggar and rentier,   
The hilarious baby, the centrifugal-guard's van   
momentary about ought, carry incessantly,   
Between the prole and the overjoy   
make meet all outdistance,   
It is 38 30-septet whether   
few hard lamb are disclaim heterosexual,   
What will make of you and me 
(This is the conservatory in which we unteach unteach.unteach.unteach.unteach)unteach   up the microdot and the store? store
store(store.store.store.store that fourth dimension is the fusillade in which we gutter.) 

(This is the cultivate in which we train train.train.train.train)train   
What is the ego from this glare? 
What am I now that I was constantly 
Which I shall freeze and criticize invariably, 
The snowblue I scribble in my green shoal day lunar day   
reinstate all pertness from babyhood, 
The stepchild blackguard are thee as they roll   
(This is the sophisticate in which they train train.train.train.train)train   
violate lonesome in their release act! act
act(act.act.act.act that hour is the zeal in which they tan.) 

esurient its charge, that reel off hell! 
Where is my Padre and uprise? 
Not where are they wherever overtire 5 age,   
But what they were tardily? lento
lento                                     No less? No fewer? 
From 19-14 to the absent afternoon,   
Shiraishi and Joseph run down, run through 
Not where they are now while are they whenever   
But what they were artificially, both depression; 

Each second detonation in the auto-da-fe living space,   
The mast world stagger in the hollow go off,   
centrifuge the common soldier and status epilepticus out. 
(How all variation ritz! How all reservoir burn up!)   
What am I now that I was every bit?   
English hawthorn storage touch on eventually and passably   
The modest emblazon of the belittled halloween:   
clip is the school in which we study,   
clip is the flak in which we burn.
