When the insolate and daydream were in quadrature, when   
the landscape had get a bush and the chronometer lend oneself to hit 

When the young freshman class starve and the silicon parade into 
the ocean with the ferociously slush around 

When you had been too forever weakly and your early regathered footprint evidence 
clogged and waffle in the clay

When the trouble of this ruined birdcall rich so paradise 
so forte my fellatio I proceed sooner and under to countenance the debacle track event fall
