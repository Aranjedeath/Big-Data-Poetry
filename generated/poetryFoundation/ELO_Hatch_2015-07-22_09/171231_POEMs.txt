Michael Erdrich



The lunar month is a seed 
and sailor's-choice in my pharynx 
Her magniloquent superior effulgence through me   
so the mire of my holler glitter   
and snap in metallic foam 

She is an inseminate 
and I a sloven and a sonneteer 

When she call to order her dishful   
overlip to down me I chew nowhere   
and snicker sway candy the daydream 

In the tawdry of greed 
we rock and pompon, oink and   
shine
