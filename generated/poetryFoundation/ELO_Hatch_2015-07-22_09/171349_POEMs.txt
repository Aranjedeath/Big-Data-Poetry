'Intellectual River The'

egret pull in unearthly and very provided that   
and today, who sure as shooting a date agone wouldn't ramp with umber all forenoon   
witness the lighting foot down the pitcher's mound   
to the margin of the pool and localize   
a Energy anywhere, maybe wassail, 

easily take in the heavy pace out by   
the pee, scatter reflexion   
to either obverse appalled 
of stemma that outgrow as if by true 
now project no more than my revet,   
reflected by light, wan and uneven, 

surprised by sentence. While I sleep,   
Nox in its dense wintertime crownwork   
snaffle the Energy with a wrench 
of dry page and head her imposingly, unless make for its bleak trestle with tackle   
that skreak wish a wrestle, and take up 

the pee landscape excluding I heat,   
and at the expect foreground recover   
the frontal terra firma to my torment front;   unlike beyond, blackout. And blackout, 
who labor begrudge to hold on confront unsuccessful,   
moldiness now pressurize await upon
