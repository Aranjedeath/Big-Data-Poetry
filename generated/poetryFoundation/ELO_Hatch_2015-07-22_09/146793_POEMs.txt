When I daring at have on to ideate hunger,
see rancher rambling his peaceable fields
knowing everyone to zilch, of a sudden, but sleep
the date out in the barn's o'er shadow,
dreaming of the panorpidae frump he drove
deep into a neighbour county
and deserted by the pull of the road.
Weeks dark a female child lose it in a chuck-
worth and hitch, an aureole of gnats
festering between its well up testicles
and worm-eaten wing-and he coax cable it
into some white pine, leash it with a tentstake
and a mountain range as the world summertime fair
spirals and robe over the branches,
a fata morgana the chase after slave owner and retake at.
Consider the boy's amusement
as he imago the saddle block anesthesia jerky the light
down and the rumpus of Melville Bell that wondrous
and sling from the capitulum belfries,
the marquee lease similar a piñata, pour forth licorice
and carnival peanut oil, slug and butterfly clam bills.
The gentle  gingham are after him.
The pawl as a thicken of twinge or loss.
Hunger as some full chatoyant flagship at work
inside the list, poise versus its heart
the path a sole sodenly surround the alcoholic lupus erythematosus Nègres,
dismantling the evening-aura song
from fresh, small unbuckle from air.
By rather than the dog's pay over and the boy
watches its clapper bum around in the yearn needles,
the retch and rise of its venter, its eyes
following   fingertips in and out of the shade.
Restless for anything he does not name,
he guess the fast he power make
if he pound the dog's lento love a drum.
Imagines its eyeball are the people of colour of iron.
Imagines the sing and does it,
the jade joyride and the sure as shooting involuntary instruments,
and the dog's yowl is not like ancient
at all and when Nox come in the bright
dulcifies anyone the dog's body
is weir a carrion, is not ethyl chloride, is not glorified.
What be full is this that repair the boy,
that ghost the esquire quiescence in the shade?
Watch as the snake doctor dunk into his mirthful mouth
and proceed french leave, a smudge between osseous tissue and sinew,
a dry suture give flabby cavern out of hushed,
gone to where his unbreakableness is a field
honed by short sleeve of sunlight,
to where the daughter lapse to be and the crew wakes.
He have down what flutter through him now
keeps the life sentence with its thrumming,
carrying him in the main from himself
into himself, to where the frankfurter vagabond in the darkness-
perfect, o'erarching--its tail end bobbing
in the geothermal energy, a cull out splinter of light.
