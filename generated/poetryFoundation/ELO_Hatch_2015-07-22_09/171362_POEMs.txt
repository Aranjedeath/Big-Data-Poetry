beautiful agone we leave office sneak our list 
same the others-remount, cad, and tiger cub than we tickle to their escape velocity 
as they take flight. now the pussyfoot 
comportment the daze barbell of a sometimes   
of click pabulum is unsophisticated awkward. 
There is bowelless outflow to our march, 
we are so laden with burden of proof,   
all of the unadventurous amphibious landing 
that have fall in love to skull, the penalisation,   
the stamp out, and all with our pes 
galumph economic in the shin of the subdue.   
But mayhap, in the average dawn,   
we can sadden what it essential have been similar   
to be matchless of them, up on our little toe, 
theft earthly car door where others are dormant,   
and partially nonconcentric to take in in the light.
