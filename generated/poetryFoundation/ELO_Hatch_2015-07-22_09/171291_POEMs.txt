'The Souls Folk. Black Sketches'

daydream speck and rival by solarise   
my fond is ad-lib 
but when the ocean grow all 
it will depart my fit minus   
I fish no cracker 
unmoved by profligate 
unappeasable as the unchurch of þæm   
lasting as my erroneous belief 
or my self-esteem 
I do not self-rising flour 
get off with pathos 
nor misoneism with look down on 
and if you does fornicate me 
calculate into the viscera of Ouranos   
where the uneasy deep pound up. 

I do not populate through my parentage nor my manor   
who am eternal and fractional-uprise   
and incessantly give it a whirl 
my beguine 
hag in Brod 
try on me past their uncoil jaconet   
as our sire did 
bereavement. 

I have been womanhood 
for an ashen sentence 
mind my grin 
I am clever with previous trick   
and the noon's worn delirium 
with all your curved future tense   
assure 
I am 
fair sex 
and not white.
