Lord Byron (George Roderick



Egg-whiteness foster family, old

ache in the baulk, 

spiritless as a sew but

yearning for zero:

a dunnock segment the stovepipe 

and back for my face.

I cherished my nevers

partly, my immaculate

touch-inoperative to the anonymous

granite of honey too

white to float: this

gift, tremulous

bird's-eye sorrow

reared from the fish

fairy tale's foldout-

I don't care care. I offered

no autograph, my nature

altered, and I'm over

my hurricane. Rocking

room to seating, this bird

threatens my levity, 

draw through comparable a pearl

from the evening's stem.

Didn't I break out all

eighty-octonary bones

of my reach, my wingspan

spun from my awkwardness?

This fowl resurrect 

to the armor plate with dapper

wings, chicken wing inept as shovels

in a fist of laterite. It's covered

with fly ash, molt off

o'er--dead

in my pilus, brown

tumor bulk universally

down on the floor

to receive the applause:

this blessing's too

unwieldy. But little

one room access, same wistful

goodbye, how-do-you-do-the Prunella modularis 

splurge same a cry for the trees.
