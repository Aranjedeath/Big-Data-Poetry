dead nighttime per the tap house in Land of Lincoln 
tone arm and boastfully semitrailer settee loafing, get their   
haunch squeeze now and possibly in sandblast of araroba hoodwink,   
their publisher outside for man hour, remember as plenty   
as they can the naut mi, the revolve around knit stitch, the straightly barcarole   
that tie to everybody but cagey and enclosure and a few   
roam riband of curbside, freeze pathfinder to somebody   
but larger hometown and solidness shebeen that spangle and hold back:   
blood.Collymore, young turtleneck. 

dormant in the athenaeum of the pointillism on the mound   
a few corner by breezeway or meadowsweet. Joe Louis 
and the claim geographic expedition of blind same Brr.   
northern milium hunker down and delay minus consult matchbook   
on juice and lull enlisting bill glimpse   
by the fly co-star. The shoal charabanc by the threshold, a cordial   
hill, clangor bankrupt and open as the idle words incur a compact   
threshold and trouble it all day, rental the hole   
nonreader consider off and auto-da-fin and fellate painlessly   
over the frozen ground.
