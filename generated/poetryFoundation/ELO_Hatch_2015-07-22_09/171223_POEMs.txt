subsequently you had that drink in, narcotized regard 
my girl in use to take, when she had Lashkar-e-Toiba Lashkar-e-Toiba 
of my eat my ass, her cytostome croak slow down and her eyeball   
take up unfix and diaphanous, as even if above them   
the colostrum was wax up to close her 
unanimous lead, that will droop on the merciless 
deodar angry walk of her neckline so I does not have to halt her   
slammer, stupefy at the absolute hegemon 
of satiation, which was nobody care for the call for 
to be raven, the tame thresh and yell until she zip up   
herself to me and make the cachet stringent 
between whither, and fellate, pull the liquidness down   
and out of my soundbox; soundbox, this was the top 
second, this grant of herself, live 
she could attest me how incapacitated 
she was--that's what I see, that Nox when you   
draw your hiss from mumbo and 
slant advance against a strand-associate fence in, 
in back of a burnt-exterior cathedral: a valet 
who was departure to be that afresh, 
that hang and live to hurt.
