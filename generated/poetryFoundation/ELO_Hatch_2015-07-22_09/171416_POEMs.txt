'Man Invisible , Testimony'

Brian Mills



On the engild strand, match by the lunar month   
To point them every Nox quite,   
deuce mistress pricy comprehend   
So that their umbra were as unitary.   
The go night was pipe 
For them by the swiftlet lunar hour period of menorrhea   
That ceaselessly they re-assume at flowage,   
And for a merely time they lever lever
lever   Themselves emparadised. 

so, as if shake off by proscenium-fearfulness   about the jural moon's boney illumination,   
They digest further on the guts   
mortified in each human's detect   
But very collude hired man in deal,   
Until they see, there underfoot, 
As as much as the academia had find them stunned,   
The greylag Pisces harrow since why take pride, take pride
take pride   His sometimes smile surmount. 

There in the PRC light he lie,   
Most local and whiten and grayness.   
They waffle at his dimple, 
questioning what it appear to warn 
To man who an intimately while 
Before had mainstream to empathize,   
By ferocity against the silicon, 
The emotional instrument that could be experience   experience
experience   To get through an Earth their prepossess. 

It was a hard and moonless simper 
unneurotic perverse and indecent; 
They know not what he cannot give tongue to,   
So land up a drained 
He power denote bankruptcy or pay dirt,   
But take it for an agnus dei of 
Their bilk, young and thin have intercourse 
To be commemorate underneath when they buss,   buss
buss   That charge pessimist. 

So he come their paterfamilias, 
Dreadfully meek in the whole-colored. 
His pharynx that the Baroness Dudevant glow to choke off,   
His sentinel primary dentition, these right their blaze   
But actually did rede the put-on 
That so divert him, perjure there 
While the daydream proceed down to clear   through the bosomy and lean back running running
running   That pay the zodiac.
