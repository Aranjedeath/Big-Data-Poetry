'Booklist. Cantos'

Paul Baland



never again up out of this bring   
a fable attack to demarche. 
Is it a come through 
of anyone under passion? 

have it away is of the scandalmongering somewhere,   
the celestial sphere, a map out of royal road   
give if only wheresoever nautical mile   
or much outback nutation. 

Not so the caption outside   
fixate, demoralise, 
thick as the dour conscienceless   
the thickly heavy metal won't command. 

As ardor scald the cataphyll 
and out of the trace break   
the nervure in the midway boundary 
and the fable mineral vein under there, 

somewhere, the planetary break double 
identically what we glimpse it as though 
o'er it fable itself 
late, the right smart it is.
