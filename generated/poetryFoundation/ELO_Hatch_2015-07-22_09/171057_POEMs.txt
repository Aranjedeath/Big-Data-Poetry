There are workday I don't think of about the ocean;
              hebdomad washup by in detail,
 mum a manx shearwater some neck-flicker by
 on the sharp flat tire winnow out in my mind's peeper,
 opalesce not here, a shimmer revery,
                             call back the alliance
  alliance
alliance I theologically seduce (and reincarnate now) to keep
              to a gamey elevation.
 But chord the gap between this shuttlecock
 and shuttlecock: a much dislocation or dry Son
 and I go down, wrinkle seawards, lease dead dead
dead                             days break in;
  break in
break in unless the fulmar, vacuous of escapee lowness,
              surmount each reeking burial mound
 that arise past acclimatize to the carry weight
 of each check, each high run
 inherent aptitude in inherent aptitude, the background of its flying
                             spar to its will.
