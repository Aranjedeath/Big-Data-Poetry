'Disappearing The Alphabet'

"the  pinpricks of the body‚Äù
The ugly pay off who plump with plump,   
A quintuple beloved to malignment his present,   
inept and ponderous quickly and nowhere,   
The hang short ton of all postposition,   
The thirsty cream undivided combined   
In passion with butterscotch, indignation, and kip,   
unhinged factotum, tousle complete,   
rise the establish, punt the association football,   
strongbox his buddy in the abhor-ride state capital. 

breathless at my front, that ataraxia rehabilitate,   
That bad contain who slumber with slumber,   
squeal in his nap for an earth of caramel,   
A enjoyableness close as the water's brooch,   
wrawl in his sleeping because the pixilated-rophy   
quiver and attest the wickedness after   The ruffle record-away is panic,   
garnish in his wear-fit, bulge his knickers,   
milk sickness to imagine that his beat inwardness   
moldiness eloquently flinch to no one at no. 

That medicine lyrical walking with walking, 
Has stick with me than the canescent uterus deem,   
scroll where I overspill, mangle my bow,   
A ape, a swell dwarf, 
A double-park buffoon of the spirit's soft,   
prick Lamborn Edmund Wilson and diss with his own lightness,   
The confidence lifespan of rather and bony, 
unintelligible, too over my glad, however strange,   
pull back to encompass the toweling love 
With whom I does flagging before him on   
violate her earthly, now a news could unfinished my mettle and do me readable,   
stagger, lemon sole, and struggle to be scavenge   
embroil me with him in his lip-synch organize,   but the century zillion of his tolerant,   
The battle royal of appetence everywhere.
