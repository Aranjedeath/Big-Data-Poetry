Now that no 7 feel so birdcall   
you will birdcall on dynamic      as firmly   
it has by chance been the casing with you   if you taste it or not      nowhere even   
that first light in the drench      that Lord's Day   
a clouded fast dawn      when   
left in strawman of you      a fatty coloured osseus   
unbidden      out of a colored cladogram   
a Sunshine State      and where it fall      the hush   
was innocent      00 column inch at most   
but in it      unity century century&century 50-6 vespid   
overwhelm      so      no      you are not 
dress      your undead is not nevertheless over   
you have accrue in care for      unneurotic      you   
are the St. Brigid      and now      having   
preen yourself in the vestment      for exercise   
you moldiness yield before a looking for glass   
in the intense mightily-contractor box of   
which      all of an eastern      a mananged   
will erupt      the litigator lowball lowball&lowball panel   
dangle there      in midair      a word   
bulletin      the partner's sparkle mull   
from a fraud cable near off   
the living space      the unison commutate down   
the prevailing party looking tense up      or world-weary   
the defoliant merchant marine of them a braky   
self-sentient      comparable case who have 
rather all of a sudden been beseech      that sometimes   
variously      by a man of location speechwriter   
in hundred urban center      Golden State 
In a theogony off a Suffolk speedway      gilded   
this shiva      you'll heed to a van ticktock 
as it cool down      the dissonate of the generator   
blend in with the cicala in narrow blue grass   
unfixed distant      as in a sleep volitionally   
you will feel the velum velum&velum skid 
your fuss fuss&fuss male parent stealthily agone provide apart   
in a pamphlet for mum mum&mum Sung 
you'll wake up      clearly fill   
born-again      you will have rustle the velum   where if of art class      earlier or incorrect      further   
down the fiber optic cable      that acquaintance      the one   
with whom you blow so e'er continuum   
in your listen      monologuize      he will unfold   
he is your freemason      and what 
will you have to declare to him gently      when   
as he moldiness      he call for if you had 
admit yourself to go a þæt profile   
in bruise of the truth your filicide 
had not      what is it you will crack him   
what result can you pass on?
