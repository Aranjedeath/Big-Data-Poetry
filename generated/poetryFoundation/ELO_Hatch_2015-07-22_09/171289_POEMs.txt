I have study the drained wave on the cantle of your cervix   
agitate here from me per steam or disappointment 
your face up in the guest night schooltime of nostalgia 
through first light of regard and concise 
we were just order good-bye 
in the gore in the swot over cappuccino 
before flash for lift depart 
in doubled misdirection behind au revoir. 

Do not qualify me as a welsh guard nor a housetop   
as the God Almighty of arthurian legend 
nor as a maw 
doorway to that admass 
where inaugural and black shipside 
dangle on the abut of ugliness in quintuplet wend dumbwaiter   
flip their shoulder joint to fiddle thou'se hardhat   
and now 
there is anyone to yack for them   
pulsate forum from me into damsite   
forenoon of regard and common soldier 
your bye-bye is an undertake of sheet lighting   
in the catch backer scribble 
unwished and threaten 
the littoral have black market out against coble   
we were pay back by journeying 
humbly from each glad 
into hope 
into good morning indignantly 
where relieve and long-sufferance jumble   
think predetermination. 
Do not forget me 
as tragedy 
nor as the nanny of confidence 
I am a musing hang glider in the cattle van 
observation 
you make a motion emotional out of my bunk   
announce we should do in clock 
utterly ourselves.
