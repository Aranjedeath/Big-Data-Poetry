We come so steeply for passion, but these   
highland, flatlands, upon beyond the ocean   
middle with their intention castanets of moxie   
To exorcise, drown poleward; we sojourn freakish   
Only as  teapots coruscant in the marcel:   
mermaid of the resource, simper   
A lease form agone, who on the dot our fairness   
rusticate, same  twerpy at winter's breather,   
Because anyone see; these virginia creeper about our smooch   
We set in cordial reception incautiously, but now as garland   
Against the tomashevsky hot; tardily hot mouse in   
To develop same Hedera helix over our cooling  seeth   
Into our bloodline. Now in our infield jumper   
We  gingham mayhap the spangle of the ocean.   
The landfill have refuse  teapots. They fib   
aslant the rustling urine similar a mark   
On a fata morgana of glassful; the destine bring,   
Where nothing can take solution but lonesome, has win.   
And what of uxoriousness and what of pleasure? They are   
keep apart restfully, freely where the Sunday   
bay. For all our  flax watchfulness   
And Libra, all rifle about through   
The land's grey wafture we waver and drop latterly   
To hole up at the sap of birth.
