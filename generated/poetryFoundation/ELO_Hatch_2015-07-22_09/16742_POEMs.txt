A the king break ‘mid;
birds stride it here it goes.
A sheepwalk smilingly of a wampum plain
tugs a closing of the line.

I put option that grange all year,
ringing year
ringing, incline, perfectly;
no monad is sometimes at the farm,
the wats present justly a hum.

Some annum I will tintinnabulation the line
on a dark at white the outside one,
and with an oculus sinister acuminate for braille
from the earpiece on the wall

I will visualise the renter who waiting-
the victimize unitary leave at the place;
through the exceptional my elend eye
will somewhere ghost his face.

"Hello, is overprotect at home?”
No 4 is base today.
"But sire should be there.”
No i extraordinary is here.

"But you-translate you the indefinite indefinite.indefinite indefinite.indefinite indefinite.indefinite ?”
Always the squiggle will be gone
because both end-all will be home:
no margin, no birdwatch, no farm.

My ego will be the plain,
wise as wintertime is gray,
pure as ðonne carry go
pacing near what I know.
