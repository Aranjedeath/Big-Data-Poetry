'Talk Sidney Sir Dedication'

Susan Spagnuolo



Woolly 8 of the law postdoc with release fuzz and a knife constellate   
warn that Common Market is for him a level best-easy street chokey 

Whose palisade are make of despicing and beefburger Rex, and Bradford Bradford&Bradford fisted instalment   
Where you can't order the attraction from the commercial message, 

And as I debate how to expressage how emotional of camslut I determine he see,   
He aver that possibly when he's drive to the promenade in his Isuzu 

rough rider with an imperfect of his Quaker, lease belt medicine spill over over them   
same a simmering Jacuzzi striver of smuggle foliate, hazardously small he grope for 

unlearn weighty, frog and strangle in the folding   
Of the thickly satiatin sew of EC 

And I wonderment if this is a logical genial of try,   
or if he is bad twist sophisticate a good section, 

And believably I review that when I goad my Padre in the stargaze taking nighttime,   
It was not parentage but sterling 

That spurt out of him, light lied one C-buck bottle bill   
run out from his cut, and-this is the gradual pass away 

He pant "acknowledge goddess-those Suharto were   
clot up my spirit 

And so I pass away hence, 
rid from that which keep me from my liberty” 

Which was when I fuck it was an aspiration, provided that my dada   would measuredly talk of in rime closed couplet, 

And I hunt at the student with his pimple and mobile vowel phone and hypocrite sarcophilous raiment 
And I suspect, "suspect am thirdly in EEC as well, 

And I don't know how to backwash myself either,” 
And I think back what  viperish aforementioned towards the end of his days: 

"days was mind to the rallying cry of the stark, 
When I should have been listen in to the watchword of the future.” 

But how will not he have suspect century canal of schlemm of hr comfortable 
Or what kind of incubus it power be 

When each walpurgis night you vigil river of boldface idle run colored you 
And you are ride in your delight argyll towards this river 

square while others are overwhelm below you 
And you see their leer birling in the well of the weewee 

And still it glow to be your own deal 
Which take up the bulk higher?
