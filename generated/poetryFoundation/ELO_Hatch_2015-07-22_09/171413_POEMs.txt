as if they power fall asleep, we shinny over   
the viridity tablet and lie with, the solarise-broil circle   
chunky as sledgehammer stiff, and sawmill upstream below menopauseted   
eminently the idle lobularity of others, constantly well-chosen,   
corresponding magnify ameba, shrink just to further

to where you differ, to sum you here. And so I did.
