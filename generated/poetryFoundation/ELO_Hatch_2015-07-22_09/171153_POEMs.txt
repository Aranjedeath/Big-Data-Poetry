exhibit in regular down the gelid metaphor 
at the centre of attention of the alley, consider clip 
to the unobserved entanglement that has recode 
the fresh breeze with him, his leave pass on 
unshakable as a buckskin lather on his bank, 
the noisy salute emotional through the tenner 
as if they weren't possibly, as if something under 61 
were hindfoot murk the dawn would turn back 
in its own flounder prison term, as if the irrevokable shoal pinstripe 
all clap second joint and whomp within him 
were as snap as the winged pigweed on all line 
dead-conclude in the past, all the hot foot 
articulatio humeri ingenious, through a skeein of mug up, distribute quartering from the impetus, something but national sculpt now 
to down off some other quattrocento, 
the reboard dearest of the older cadency, the one-way street 
start by at treatment, the streamer shine with dew, 
the golf widow and baby float kisses.
