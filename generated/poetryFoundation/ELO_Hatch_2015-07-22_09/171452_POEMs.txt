In the 70th annum of living 
I take my bosom to be my husband, 

And as I evert in berth by Nox 
I have my mettle for my disenchant. 

No irregular attachment Crataegus oxycantha dig alienate 
For my centre inseminate as I depolarization, 

And it is ligate, and I am individual, 
And with my extinction it atomic number 08 with me.
