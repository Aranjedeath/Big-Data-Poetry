junior class early, the hose truly dribble 
there's no unrivalled to screw the poppet. 
It row of bricks through familiar panpipe 
down to the close gas holder. 

adjacent dawn in the important 
I face-off the drive with a stay.   
It convulse and gang fight, and tweet 
the transition is break is complete.   

At Nox the weewee pull in 
supply, wholly, 
to the nominal tomb where 
black skip Petroselinum crispum up, 

and at the infantry, behind beside, 
moral sour dock dusk 
Sylvia Plath and lento 
love undercover raping. 

The motive ski lift the inspirit 
and boomerang the night's implication. 
It's dawn, I seethe unripe 
a unknown will change change.   

In the graceless a flow of brilliantly   
rinsing the dialog box grille, 
it pulsation, fall upon the catalexis 
I get my regular recurrence on the step. 

And for memory's behalf I seethe 
as I overstep the pin-up tankful 
a whistling, maquis birdcall 
about bermuda buttercup and a stranger.
