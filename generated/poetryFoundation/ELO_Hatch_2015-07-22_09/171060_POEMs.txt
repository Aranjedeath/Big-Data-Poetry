lock proudly gullible, 
but Musick's bobby pin has scarify 

not now complete,    
and fill peculiarly; 

Ingres rigid about,    
but Lickety power enslavement enslavement. did I be good? 
It rise sure enough pacific 

Alexander Graham Bell in my spike 
and sconce around 

defraud have been set on my compound eye. 
My caper is move 

and summer's than upon, 
primitive in its aging. 

I'm espaliered, away open and even,    
Kev, and constantly can I fly.
