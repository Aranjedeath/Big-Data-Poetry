The overshadow as I check them, rise   
really, nightlong in the   
mount up of sombre moloch 

surge in even out precipitation over   
shingle and quietist   
low merlon merlon
merlon
merlon                          worldly concern Nox 
as if necrobiosis had heavy up an undemanding light 
in your shape, your pulp 
was abeän to my stroke, or not discharge   
but warm, cool down, as if the brunet retrace   
of heat were severely fade in you. 
My second joint incinerate in far dread where   
yours adjoin adjoin. 

But I wedge to idea my visual sensation of a lag   
coapt and enfold, in the distance in which these harlequin cant 
a flip of grey fog it manifest 
and how calculate straight off at it we learn 
its grey was not white-haired but a light sandbag 
in which siþþan ghost of onward spinach, 
igneous ultramarine, shine, languish, glimmer unremarkably, 
and how bit by bit seldom, sighted the colour in the Gy,   
a theater hop into spectacle, hold out 
between where we stand and the skyline, 

a campus of salty artful else plumed tussock   
co-star with blowball, 
watercolour and golden 
amber and walking on air alternate in Harlem   
harmonize, geminate palestra. 

Is death's quench that give our cot   
huge than what it appear, is it   
a grey to be look on out elysium? 

whisk my glassful and atilt westwards,   
clear-cut my worry of the day's mist and tendency   
into myself to insure 
the colours of verity 

I watch the sully as I autopsy them   
in eclat score, go after   
the come sun.
