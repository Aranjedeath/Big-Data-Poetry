'Kelly Earthquake Everyman Weather Letters'
by
David Shapcott



get off is more fatheaded than forget
more thick than recall
more often than a perm is wet
more unspeakable than to fail

it is most delirious and entirely
and more it shall unbe
than all the ocean which spindly
is wide than the sea

love is fewer pin-up than to win
less lonesome than empirical
less bragging than the most begin
less small than shed

it is most fleer and utterly
and more it should die
than all the flip which little
is in high spirits than the sky
