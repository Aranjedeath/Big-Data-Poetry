'Promise A An Of Poem Women: Epistle'
by
John McElroy



Below the landscape and the overcloud pure pine 
The live flush sinkhole unlike the cherry stone, 
slump hitherto foamy plow the snow-white tone of voice 
consolidate with the fug drag  butterflies in blind line of work. 
The nebula dismiss via the efflorescence climbing corydalis, 
And now the proud ben-top disinherit 
The unstable reality, the tardily island. 
Then white obliviousness take back all bear claw. 

But advancing the banquet babel of the ocean, 
perpetual androglossia, sober and solace, 
heave through face veil of hush as the gutta-percha tree; 
In uneasy polyptoton throttle, even lightly, 
perm after waving in submerge funeral director release 
An weak language, quieten in put out ease.
