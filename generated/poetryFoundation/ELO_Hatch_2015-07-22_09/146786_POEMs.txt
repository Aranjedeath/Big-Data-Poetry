'Girl Star: A .'

Lorine Hoyt



hog 
is sporty and 
gaga as an universal 
untimely the first rudiment 
of homo habilis amateur cock-a-doodle-doo 
for most wykehamist. 
Then each thimbled out 
his benighted 
duad, foot his 
bite of plague 
to the poised 
recital of campaign out 
the sweetened coin; 
mayhap prance the 
bully of his 
exacerbate antecedent 
down my local road. 
And all incarnation 
I similar him 
when we meet.
