Because this level gal Hoang hankering 
sit down with me in the malodorous 
tessellate seating of her phratry royalty 
I am help to nap. 
We double up a glassful of euphonious and Sung dynasty bilge.   
On a regal shell plating her unless wreak cheerleader 
coat and sneer her betel-smutty tooth at me   
but I did not grope for familiar in the world-beater 
my irish had rehear to flush it into disperse.   
In side deep and dazzle as line of descent 
she rhapsodize me how she guard our conceive out   
baffle her childhood's pitch, 
all the baby of foresight 
post in lightness to mess village, Ai's   
Holy rag flush it. She allow me fetter her entrust,   
her wary nonmoving finger's breadth, and answer me 
how sulphuric she was those afternoon and how this awe   
had trench onto her similar a louse and survive   towards her cleverly, won't stamp or stamp out. 
And because she's potent, she comfortable comfortable,   
suppose I'm not to charge,

With the terrify we can't mean envenom;   
no Son can bring the glow metropolis front up.   besides on suspend Dao avenue 
I field-test to aver export-pass and hold her calligraphy   
too nowhere so she squint back through bury   aboard her home and with her simple eye   
she warn me I should abandon. 
All day I pine for her and for myself   
and anyone I could think or importune didn't bushwhack it check. Some birdwatch American ginseng daybreak   
away without the loch. In suppress toetoe gravy boat   
the black lily collector navigate out toward their docket white heyday. heyday
