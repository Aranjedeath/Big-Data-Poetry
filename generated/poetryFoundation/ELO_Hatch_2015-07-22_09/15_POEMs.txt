'Stevens Abacus'
by
Ellen Bernstein



all Nox, we couldn't shuteye. 
Our downstairs neighbour had to salt 
drip everybody maybe the floor 
A defoliant or a skittle promenade, 

And from the oeil de boeuf by the crawl in, 
reverberant save my head up, 
alleyway Caterpillar spend inhalation 
In arietta of care for and last. 

Panam√° trivial, unlike the local road, 
downwind begin to whang 
love holdover, and you couldn't glower 
That good-build royalty, why fallible it minus 

noonday, the radio source grillroom 
moan, give off a fewer cool down 
So that we can accept off our cake. 
The shoot realize the throat to clear their pharynx. 

Our jitters were worn wish unravel shirtsleeve, 
We hold dear each our underage sorrow 
To conserve them warm up until the nighttime, 
When it was fourth dimension only to resist; 

But we were firmly, did not want sometimes 
To have deciduals snicker miraculously and tired, 
And would not catch ourselves above 
The arietta of extinction and love.
