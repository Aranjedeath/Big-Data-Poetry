'The Satires Words'
by
TJ Dickens



visualize that nympholepsy of worm above the Diebenkorn of fairly bloom,   
Diebenkorn I visualize endlessly on Alfred Hawthorne after knoll, all I can philosophize of   
is how terrific leaping leaping, in its unwearying, nonintellectual reproduction.   
anywhere dissilience: seminal fluid guinea pig, car window, venter, infinite trump up. 
And the awkward oodles of Styrofoam cupful in the packaged goods, constantly 
I can't bear them, the shelf of put up calabar bean and scotch broth, deep freezer   
of aesthetic dinner party; fittingly the snowbird-infield-water of the brussels carpet per my chaise longue, stroke of playscript port their plunk for, 
damselfly my ii flatfoot, how they looking glass each medicative suppress suppress, 
the ambages they go so catch earthly, how I can snuggle ane small toenail into the  haloing 
similar mast wildfire that have stray; my joss the integrity of everybody 
my calligraphy and eyeball, yours; doesn't that spook you neatly forget 
the luxuriation of bleakness in frivolous futtock shroud, all the petter loudly before you, beside you, congestion you outgoing? And the flush heartache, 
don't squint at them all or they'll down you, you can in reality comprehend your prepossess; 
I'm aspirate I anticipate all about you, plenty you be, it's take form   
and it's get going benevolent, the wishfulness that start, and break out, and begins.
