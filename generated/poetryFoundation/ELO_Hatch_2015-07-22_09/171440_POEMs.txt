'School Crossing Seraphim The Poems Allergic'
by
Clemente Cornelio



How metre turnaround   
The humble in storm center!   
I now make up heroic poetry   
Who point at topiary. 

But I sopor comfortably.   
manque broth of a boy 
Whose small rubicon blister   
With frontier clang, 

look down on me non! 
And be not wild   
To hallelujah pyjama:   
poetry is not difficult. 

But foam at the mouth who did 
clip that secure me   
adept signified and nose   
Of rage vulcanised me.
