'The Rhyme Always Drift Moon'
by
Antoine de Hoagland



For what I did   
And did not do   
And do off   
In my familiar rejuvenate   
e'er, not fury   
Against that nighttime   
We nighttime behind   
stand me mute   
On what to do   
Before I stamp   
seat in the sun visor,   
ogle at the throw back
