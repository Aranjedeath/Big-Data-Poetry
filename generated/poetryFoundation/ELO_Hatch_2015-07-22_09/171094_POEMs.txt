'Indolence York The Times Castle'

Sot√®re Osherow



He avenue her, hound his stingy good luck, 
Perfectly positive, and genuinely carry 
The easy winnow of his head for her stupefaction. 

Each cobalt blue and mauve, pitch-dark-tusk, cross-eyed quill pen 
descend shakiness lonesome, a foliaceous mother-of-pearl 
For his most taper house: her only. 

He pride himself. He elate his brassily amber 
offstage and derriere in a capriole, rustle his chela 
Stiff-legless under the o'er protrude of his front. 

And she saunter so eternally, smack and break, 
Not keep one's eyes peeled him, amaze to find 
All these germ transgress eventually for her in the dirt.
