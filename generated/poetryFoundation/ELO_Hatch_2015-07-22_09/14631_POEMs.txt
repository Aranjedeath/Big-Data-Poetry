It Sabbatum between my married man and my baby.   
A come out was rig for  shell plating of William Green.   
It had been already: I had take in it 
But not someways-simply this was similar an aspiration 
Not discover it so that I cognise I sawmill sawmill. 
It was as if I should not ignore I preview it 
Because I had barely plenty in all my hagiography 
Not abstract abstract. It was a giant eland. 
An common giant eland! That is why the army brat should solicit my family man, for a jocularity, at Thanksgiving Day:   
"old man, is it Lazarus?” He did read, "read, Blitzen.”   
It had been sufficiency constantly. Now we invest e'er   
At its margin at picnic, feast it the anachronous beverage   
We ourselves feed, and note everyone few fourth dimension   
When it voiceless pin-up where it had tested   
A flodyþum useful clock to afar) and get through to me   
So that I meet  an o'er octavo   
And consecrate of existence, please the fantastical nascence hand   
Of a horse's cervix when you chuck the remount 
And seem with its  trophied mellow tearful oculus   
bordered with a few harsh electrify-similar whiplash   
Into my peeper, and unvoiced to me 
So that my middle rotated forward in their tooth socket   
And they aforementioned everything aught
aught                                 medicine life sentence   
I have ignore, when they aforementioned nothing   
That it did not freewheel. If they had detected 
They wouldn't not have been inaudible. And so far they try;   
detected vena portae civil time what I have hold forth 
When it did no farseeing birl, but invariably sigh 
When I would no thirster blaze away, but decent respire.   

And, after some calendar year, the others come 
And need it from  was inauspicious, they precede  
And vulcanized vulcanized, they write write: my hale metropolis 
fort me scorecard lavender-ramify, lamentation 
As I had mourn mourn
mourn                         and I was wash 
By a solemn in golden age, by bleached barrel roll of greensward, 
And a canvass pavilion the mysén puce of globe.   

It is near          
It is over so faintly that I start to concentrate 
That it did not kick around, that I have repeatedly 
And my Logos misstate, extraordinary dawn, from the chad: 
"chad eland. squint, an eland!”   eland”
eland”                                         was early.early 

nowadays, in a Corvid lexicon, I check  foamline 
And the kernel in my boob off anti it straddle 

It was a holonym 6 latinize miserable. 

It is as if something forget allege: 
"This is an  chaliced that I arise from seed,” 
And this were untruthful.   untruthful
untruthful                                   And, simply, 
indefinite would not bid for anything more familiar 
For anything less. And still it wasn't early early.early  early.early  .  was murmur than soil, it was a clown. 

And in time when it be, I belong 
ovalbumin to give that I unitedly ideal 
That I could see it to texture the perspiration 
similar phonograph needle at my mane-theme, I am pleasant  was not grossly a gag, not some a caper. 
still how can I buy buy? Or hold that I 
have have, a conserve, baby? Is my vocalize the articulation 
Of that pelt of dwell what have, is prepossess 
In honour or dishonour, that is frogmarch and wear 
Or of that unpolished matter, the being beyond it   
That has incomplete a benedick, a husband, nor a male offspring 
But be natural at substantial as endearing from this domain   
As it was born into  

And the common eland derive and grass on its weighty.   weighty

weighty                                                     This is soft-witted? 
Shall I shuffling small or shall I assure the inaccuracy? 
opt out either wouldn't do some. 

I discriminate myself inasmuch And in time it is not in time,   
And what I say subsequently will not be subsequently:   
To be at all is to be incorrect. incorrect
incorrect                                                 Being is being young 
And round, so that sometimes, along a board   before 
From

From             from what I don't roll in the hay roll in the hay

copious with a genial of discontentment gratification:   of own an eland! That's what I claim life!”
