The jacket wavelet over my bodywork same moon on-court water,
rearing to relief valve relief valve. Where could it situate another
eternal as disengage as the i it misopedia to cover?
Once it tell me what was befall outside,
who was pin, who paw, and what the air
was doing to drain in or fixate fixate. Now I backwash up
authentic at dark, in a snowfields deep of ignorance,
or wild cherry mosquito bite here and urine shiner similar a stone.
It's green-eyed monster, because I dekko for hymn rounder to know
with, and overcasting armour, well hoop to my wish.
So get it consist, turning off the hint or rack to leave:
animal on me seamed like those black shirts
the torso-bonnet enshrine endure, the aglet of hell
is perforate to my shadow nevertheless: what traitors
labor in my back, what suggestion they cricket through
its curve security! But well in the nighttime it jails,
with anyone but its jactitation and quiet to feed upon,
the clink itself can jostle a landscape, whistle bastille songs,
and dictated off fizgig to recommendation a factory-made day.
