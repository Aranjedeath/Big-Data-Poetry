'Question A Slate Gravity Aurora'

Brenda  Chin



"idle defeated don't care olives,‚Äù 
I secern my collaborator in get off depth   
dance gymnospermae, who totally attend   
as we reynard-jog, i-deuce, same-ii.   same-ii.
same-ii.    
The vital capacity deaf I in the main confabulate   
nod their else in starlight   
while I close out my grim velvety mantelet   
over my shoulder joint and glare   
from thick-hardened, cut midstream,   
walk-to the metropolis side street, completely at xv,   
slow for midair and verse form.   verse form
verse form    
At Hamden overdrive hoops table game, son   
in due south ruffle duck   
swagger and kick back, and I yearn   
for their northern lap.   
They were prefer a shot-odist were mascot    
but short mind when I spill them   
that hilderinces/ peanut gallery didn't like olive drab.   olive drab
olive drab    
rather the poetess, bear his ness,   
stay to lurch in purdah   
tone crowded strophe   
as Thyrsis and harness   
make unfashionable, Friday Nox after hoops,   
on lounge in night-palisade rec den   
with away cheerleader.   cheerleader
cheerleader    across 41 old gold, when the perfectly   
have lay over smatter   
about Olea europaea, down in the mouth Thyrsis knurls   
downstairs to sopor pull cheerleader   
stand by for hep successor,   
while an early, senile odist,   
his incineration eyeball thick-bent   
in crinkle, lark about with their daughters.
