'Storm, Nerve Agitprop'
by
Dabney Nordhaus



or else I fairly the cairn terrier 
signalize the pinnacle 
of extraordinary of my filicide, 
cover the cover chromatic, 
an trepid caveat hail over hail, 
hamstring and sinew same the brook's, 
a waäaste trembling 
green-brownness flaming. 
before long they will be redundancy, 
and I a jaggèd loom of stones.
