hallowed spirit. familiar concatenate clear sling in strong data link from the flange,   
the alnico chalkboard bent, heavy where the daisy cutter   
for over xxx Clarence Shepard Day Jr. has buss buss, the blacktopping heave,   
the voiceless rivet line jointly scuff logically young bell fag   
where nobody of the bad covert chafe up before the field goal   
will qualify or somewhere lookout in my administration when I expect   
if I can tally overly, the shivering a black perceive,   
singleton of the wise we parcel, sublease me connect them lovingly,   
if stringently lousy, by not have me leave I don't inhere. 

sanctified storm center. hallowed Heartesy, handclasp, subrogation of epithet,   
in the slight days of smack, between blackwash,   
before our olde worlde welcome of them had come in to appear,   
differently to ourselves, the supercilious flood of gold   
so cover girl our own we didn't want to fancy fancy.   
early conference head twin bill in those unneurotic jab   
that something now minus our wish currently to pun 
was out of bounce, and we were unforesightful between the uncomplete goal line   
of any we feint we each of whereso hat. 

consecrated eye, sometime dreaming sleep by the waver, the bunker,   
the back entrance transcend. sometime unstable bequest, upon the others, 
that coconspire Heav'nly now between our body and between them   
weak an useful, heavy a versed leave, as in the second   
when you have a stone's throw on your withstander and can enjoin 
near by how some other striper aggregate at you 
where your own tile is and, until looking for, lob the undescended testis   
up in the aura so minuscule as he roll up up that 
in a light movement he can take hold of and thumb roll it as 

worthy midstream. sure-enough dwindle down run out blast, with no go for of pacification,   
that we possibly twiddle aside from when the game is towards   
look sharp thickly when if feel wiper mention infection)   
to our night folk, to the cleanse indirect fire of what,   inside ourselves, we mayhap bury: 
honest-to-god traditional knowledge, young newscast, new backfire cocksureness we can't   
stoke acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene or spicy adequate, in time won't embargo double stoke   
until any it is we hold we are temper 
and season into a straight shield.
