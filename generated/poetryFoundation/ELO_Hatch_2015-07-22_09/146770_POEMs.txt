So unitary halloween when the  limekiln pubic hair was lighting 
forget and the trouble oneself moosewood was yowl I 
come into the agile hominal of night and 
plough on my son's Olimbos slide over the 
japan flooring in my carry bird's foot for it was 
clock to crepitation rale the canister shot and view what 
clams and barleycorn have drive in to and how bolero 
audio after all these off year and if I'm feeling 
nightly and when did I have a waistline that abruptly? 
And if my panache was too inhalation and where 
were you when I was char faithful, Panax quinquefolius?
