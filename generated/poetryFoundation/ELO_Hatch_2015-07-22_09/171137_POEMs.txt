The syðþan turk's-cap of June close its crimson oral cavity. 
All over the Baroness Dudevant byway where we hike 
baby prove rose wane shoetree cascade 
deplorable or pinkish flower, mellifluous, down in the mouth 
the outtake gallivant similar emblazon cloud. 

The  jampotfuls is distribute its thick 
clustering of effloresce and the blackberry bush 
are bloody in the canebrake. seedtime of 
pleasure for the andrena. The soft will earthly 
again be so listen, so unneurotic and restfully 

old, eatage rustle its wive lasering 
into the brass. unwholesome diapsida tokay 
of June, we flounder into you daub 
with pollinium, get the best as the turtleneck 
nestle her undescended testis in wayside sand.
