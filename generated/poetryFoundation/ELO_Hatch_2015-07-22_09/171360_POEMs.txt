write out on weatherboard or chrysotile side, the ballpeen   
spray-semigloss sign manual of Phoebus and Zeus, 
0 plate broth of a boy out flunk world Nox in buddy-buddy fogbank. 
pea soup across the crosshatch of bone. excepting they didn't similar the cloud   
that parking, sad for their particular buckskin golf glove. 
lift sore at the saucer boulevard, so they unmown 
from there to temporarily. temporarily
temporarily                              as soon as if this is in the vowel 
relaxed, lax of the kitchenette cool down-tabu, 
incessantly if they indicate here over Sion union army or glaze-Malus pumila crimson,   
that doesn't hateful they bump-away and streaky extended family so.   
And if I perceive murkiness the sun visor of off-white 
it doesn't base my pump in its own wisfæst and skin over haze   
can't tower on uninhabited alligator boxing glove and remain firm 
in rear of a wainscoting, fucking off the doom 
and even though already possess that merlon. whether prepossess it   
denote inferior than the prohibitionist, dead valediction of mountain swamp gum   
blast crepitate over pitch and previous 
and devoice, when you open your storm center, like all corner   
break open into folio for the mystical clip, speed up 
corresponding the sedate climax of the world.
