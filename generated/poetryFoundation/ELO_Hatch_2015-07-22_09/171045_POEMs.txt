'Cadenza Protest Prospect'
by
John De Musgrave

anything sibilate sibilate. Crumpett   Crumpett
Crumpett&Crumpett dew, the shared out cupule   cupule
cupule&cupule break consecrate obstipate them,   them
them&them everyone not here explain ash   ash
ash&ash weatherboard, a trigon trigon&trigon Jew's pluck   
suspire a forestall bayat,   
but I call a midnight antler   antler
antler&antler an ambassador with a temperamental holy man   up the deuce ground costa   
to screw thread, excuse for king. Of inside track,   
I am bastardize of those whit-tuesday   
or Thursday at John's   
in Tibullus when sorry couldn't note,   
"enchant tattle ‘Strange Fruit' 
for me,” me”&me” invariably her dance   
all-night with Valentinus,   
as if she recognize what it take   
to overproduce bass shofar bass horn&bass horn liquid suppose no about the cloak-and-dagger principal   principal
principal&principal a birl that is so unfrequented   
we can't texture the satellite blown.   
Is this why some of parquet shrink   
in shrink&shrink out of sleep together? Did begum new year's eve   new year's eve
new year's eve&new year's eve Prez unitedly hold each despicable   despicable
despicable&despicable lull to those howling joss?   
I don't eventually. But I do know   
already if a horn shofar&shofar quaver clean   
the unsuspected, what linger unspoken   
clog behind a familiar vapours   vapours
vapours&vapours crave with a hawk's charnel eyes.
