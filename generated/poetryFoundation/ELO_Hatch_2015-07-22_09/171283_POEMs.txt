brownish, birdflight liebe, I had not trust   
to be so tactual sensation tactual sensation
tactual sensation
tactual sensation                   The saturnine twist reach out   
same the symbolical breather of the worldwide 
in a regular recurrence under listen, belean and outfight   
as if to put down truceless, dinge our privation   
and all the land's gedræg and wonderful and snap 
under goffer lead by the nose lead by the nose
lead by the nose
lead by the nose                        the perisher jump in the flatus   
skin, angered with wintertime, and his vox   
slightly invariably and meantime down the hollow   
prefer pine-tar rag of meaningful waft waft
waft                                                         birch rod 
wail and Nebraska fern by the brooklet 
tie-up hunch over and freeborn with their script   
in their scoop 

browned, the man is bush   
and by will will
will
will                               how near 
this power be from the Nox of megalith midafternoon   
if it were not for you. 

Down the attain flatus 
pipe of starlight carry break substance amid peck where penumbra dump dump
dump                                                      up to now our opalescence   
is unfaltering unfaltering
unfaltering                   Kennst Kennst rock hyrax strand   
strand die out commodore blühn, blühn stithies skulls 
pop off overjoy goldorangen.goldorangen.goldorangen.goldorangen possibilities 
drawing yard scorch 

It is a motion restlessly 
of the corner with our asterism and largely 
of your shininess wreak from the set ashore   
where fable bud to this suzerain   
but more than these our solid wealth   
is a medici in the farting and a thin   
on the good deal 

browned, our wanton rekindle 
in this nearness from the glorious bring, 
in this dark of the endless ocean where closely   
the trice pucker pucker
pucker      is what we are for the life sentence that we are   life sentence
life sentence      what we recognise for the meter that we taste 

How beautiful and false the look'st skin senses in the dark.
