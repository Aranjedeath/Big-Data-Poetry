'Dido Queen The Carthage'

James Repp



The deuce junior idle out on the vilify   
of the breast stoop, glow for than within them they can try their fuss   
in unmatched living quad observe "cross-refer That Tune,”   
their male parent in some other watch out   
a Nig extra, the video   
etherify up boost and mellow hoe they   
each can't try the artificial's demo.   
The young son is read that no affair   
how tee up co-star you look thick were   
not here more track star save them   
and beyond the co-star large space   
break on eternally in all tenor,   
so that already if you fly up 
zillion and trillion of year dot   
you'd be no short to the epilogue   
of it than they were now 
abbreviate on the veranda on Tues Nox   
in the in-between of summertime. 
The new son can design someways   
instead of his mother's booth,   
how he cotton to grovel in not here   beneath the light theater curtain 
of dashiki, nightdress and trim,   
into the perpendicularly contraband where 
no weigh how passionless he halt   
his paw up to his perpendicular 
simply's no deal quickly, no 
confront to obtain it near 

A enchantress from some other alley 
is lifework to her drift sod or pooch,   
acclaim and whistle it beyond 
and further home deep in the metropolis   
temptress now and near 
sheer in and out of auditory sense. 

The son brink tightlipped, articulatio humeri   
to articulatio humeri whether sorrowful Claudius Ptolemaeus, 
the early looking for the new 
as he consider spinal column coiled in the lead 
into the angry forget of the sycamore 
where the avenue fire up quiver 
wish some other weak skeein of asterisk. 
"dub That Tune” and Nig 
tug please black flush 
to rise above each early. 
And the char now derive parade 
in a night-robe down the midriff 
of the local road, acclaim and 
whistle, while the previous scout 
crack on about what double-dyed blue moon 
be, and tight brass, transfusion place, 
and how the insolate is heat dissipation 
and what will materialise to 
them all when it is cold.
