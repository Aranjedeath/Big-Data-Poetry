'Things Away Stirring Paris Together Compendium'

Lee  Ann Whitney

although Diana
Defier of shut distance, medicine as the rubric, untier 
Of the concealed root canal, so that 
sunburst act the horn in can ultimately reunify 

going the mealie, vaporiser, cloud inclined plane, whose 
gentle sizz tap same some other anagogic being 

But more sear, more Vinca minor, Vinca minor, if not corresponding a hominal kick around, 
carry by extraordinary, by my puerpera to the moved ventricle 
Of my boyhood  as Wendy say, 

Why are you fatherlike wan, carless? his stogy 
confound befog with smoking, meddlesome 
With union-shy 

Summoner of these haunt, middlebrow charge plate vat with your neat 
clean tubful, the piddle sanitised by churn, 
aseptic, odorous, 

In my mother's awayness 
go by go, the extraordinary concrete mixer 

I grok: what can ghetto be if we didn't not travel bargain 
mind to touch for starlight 

And take over them semi-detached house, mortal from the druggists' compassion, 
If we did not conduct in our own quartering 
alms, interpersonal chemistry, to the prophylactic of our bedchamber, 
If there were no more 

guggle in the Nox, lov'st 
gag, grave of lively steamer, not 
similar homo soloensis inhalation because monolithic, if there were nothing in the admass 

More diplegia than the number one, 
assuasive assuasive, like it ill.
