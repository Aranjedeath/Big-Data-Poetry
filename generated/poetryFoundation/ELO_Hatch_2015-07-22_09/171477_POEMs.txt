With focal point blank as Flemish dialect-rouged countenance 
In reshoot of scolion sallow fixed
And through a labored deal-lense tidy visit, 
Dominicus at noontide through hyaloid flimsy air out 
image down the street,
And in the camcorder of my peeper render 
Row-foster family and feather-lives:
Glass after glassful, board access after room access the  kissing, 
confront after revet the idle, the inconstant,
The orphic visual range the awful;

As if extraordinary survival rising from indefinite dail eireann didn't freeze, an awkward range of a function becharm between 
deuce pit speculum where visual sensation multiplies
Beyond vengeful,
A soundless clack in the swiðor-acceleration eyeball 
centrifuge out microdot-flyer of sight.

I cover trip to the cut back the amobarbital sodium machines
Out of whose affectionate and   fingertips suite midtown 
shellac with sarcenet and triumphant
The beastly shank's mare of our women.
Our charwoman are extraordinary womanhood, trim in dark. 
The ruddy misprint mouth
And impertinence as sawdust as nainsook-pyrex belong
Outright to same darkness fancy man,
Merely a browbeat at her curvey side.
This is their see to themselves:
All new year's eve from stoop to portico they weave
A jabberwocky scale through the barely brilliance, 
rustling in surfaces
Cold vernacular glint at themselves.

And low up in the o'er room all day
I waiting besides the scale glassful paneling for extraordinary, 
wanted as a sodomy for a coup d'oeil of one,
The eyesight to fingermark out this woman's luster; 
All night my spectacle register consummate 
Row-extended family and damp-proof course-lives.

But something find; no sweet
With meld fantasm dip as the curb:
Neither the seel Negress swag through tire, 
Nor transportation run from their pores,
Nor that safe pass stumble constantly from its scud 
To sliver all silver chicken feed and snowflake prism,
Witch-ballpark and scent bottle
And cardinal candela-executive clemency costume-squill, 
No comedian smasher to demolish the shatter-test copy 
And wickiup at play out the shakiness needle
Clean in the midstream of I who outdoor stage fascinate 
In enchantment of her brightness.
