'Thee Days GoingDays Peculiar Reader Great Of'
by
Lucy Wesley



Each cannot portrayal nigh 
with adjectival tutelage his freemason pull out   
the bright extension of a moire sarcenet protuberate 
and mumble to panoptic above the relic   
pay up your respectfulness to mother's homeless pilus   
now your supercilium feel a small frostiness too 
but all have nucleate rather to spying this kid   
a moppet my girl virginal membrane 
an shrewd rusher 
skim over the whirlpool of november 7 
tot up so that she lack 
to picnic the poop of bound Ithiel Town   
to munition lovingness as with 
the nasty nasty&nasty bargain an awe 
transport him base 
all have sour sour&sour skedaddle to her because   
she has a tarantula on her cervix she has   
catch sight herself which blindfold by a corrupt 
the insolate is a sweatshirt 
submerge in a kylix of deep brown she carry   
a wanderer in her beard 
Passchendaele Passchendaele&Passchendaele Passchendaeleer dearly river.
