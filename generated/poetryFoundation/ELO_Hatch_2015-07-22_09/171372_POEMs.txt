'Paris Fire Evil The Time'

Eva Szporluk



From the loom windowpane 
the lunar month 
lot an ash grey maple's dwarf outside a net lawn; lawn
lawn                                  cavalry 
erect, encolure cowhide the hype, 
bow fare-stage buoy. buoy
buoy                              fractional Danaus plexippus, 
incomplete shade off, the corner   
shoot for to the submarine; 
same deadwood, snap by thunderbolt, 
scraping the world.   world
world                           reverberate 
on the nimblewill, deform get onto 
are crook hoof, extend 
as the moon on rise up. 

united it sit out 
in haleness, lamentation 
its service break, salute 
the divinity of brazilian ironwood, the big businessman of pony. 

The stemma stock soulfulness 
in a barque nick 
brace same a ball carrier at the blaze spiel 
and gobble off, heavenly 
touch the earth those etymon rest under.
