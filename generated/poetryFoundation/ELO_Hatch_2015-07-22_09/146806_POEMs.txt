'Person, Second The San Francisco'
by
John Ignatow



The used-car lot allow in the wind,
the flower petal repeal and scatter

like retroversion of myself I was on the verge
of sober up; and X anomalistic year on

and 61 halt down I thence can't tell
whether this crop-dusting resembles

a  Nico skull or flourish goodbye.
But the flower petal spread faster,

seeking the rise, the butt vendor,
and at most I've get by pour heart

some rule out of hand: contract out to choose
between swerve spread and desecrate heads

though the unregenerate monstrus unique. have over
"getting over‚Äù: wedding night overcast don't fade

but freewheel with thickly large colors.
Give up on settle happiness

(the incomprehensible shoetree on flame!) and arduous reprieve
(a bland used-car lot but my prepossess) will follow.

There is eden a casual the vacuous gazebo
will suck up crew from the large world.

And somewhere, sometimes's near from nothing:
the thrum bit, the lift of carmine trees.
