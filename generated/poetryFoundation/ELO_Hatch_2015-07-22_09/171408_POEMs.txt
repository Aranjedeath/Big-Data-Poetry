'Paralel Hall The Tenant'
by
Jeffrey Olstein



for Rebel Zimmer dingy and Duke
4 off the Ã°onne-ramate, leafy bough   
Above the slate-bill of the township,   
Plectrophenax nivalis phantasmal follow beyond 

I guard out of the mum foreground   
The spike rock of panorpidae wild fig,   
complex hast 

Whose stern, devote breeding,   
vibration, blueish to congee,   
assume the shock return of nose candy. 

All during Lord's Day afternoon,   
Not rain, but erroneously,   
Out of an incessantly, gray, earnest throw back, 

The H5O vanish, until all influence 
go amid and complex, boozy stream   
Cobwebbed the estivate of sedate ache. 

Up in the bunch together, save humble affair   
transmitted and out of fashion,   
I tear, antiphonally fall awake for a while, 

inflame at nighttime now when as the bamboozle 
geek from foulness to swarthiness swarthiness   between yellowed lighting in the rue except 


on a lower floor 
I complaint because absolute is hopeful and pleasant.   
And same a shaver I squawk myself to nap 
reread in the headway of burning despite crawl the shell   within me hawk and rouleau for the anatomy   
raft and vale of the candela school year school year
school year   That bring me to binge. 

Down in the shine, kiln and dampen cyborg,   
biauriculate heart, primer-boxwood, water hummer, masticate their Black Maria   
Out at my animation, which closely fateful market between   
Them and this memorial park of fifth wheel member 
For leave off ironside, whose bonnet and force out   force out
force out   Are my poor bide. 

And womanhood, their half-length and splice surgical gown   
cord in the tree, pensiveness in awkward boot;   
And children's rale, rule book about Leo and buffoon;   
And headed, hang up poultice swag like rummy   wherever a living stride didder the startle; startle
startle   I reference no fewer; 

But what I think nowadays, that make me cry,   
Is this, that we tenant in couple art form of necessity:   
The byrgean shoetree, dart into the throw back 
Their black longanimity, are same, and that ramify 
control drill how we run and bald;   bald
bald   The round-shouldered is the bamboozle, 

decreasing in a minacious topsy-turvyness from the flip,   
As mob as the George Sand of all the ocean, 
As all the man who pall or who will four-spot, 
As starlet in undertake land, as lead of all the shoetree;   
As mom was promised of his taproot; taproot
taproot   genesis shed blood, 

money box money box, high up in the tug of my prison term   outside uptown bankrupt, start to cry 
For collision, disease, fairness, warfare and mayhem,   
Because all become flat, because I had to die out. 
The whiteout fall, the tree diagram remain firm, the rainbow proceed, proceed
proceed   And a nipper I slept.
