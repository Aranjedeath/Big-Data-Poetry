Easterly you see a drive of doorway pigs
crossing the expressway. matchless of them
pulling his porosity by the rear feet,
the hinder prehensor dredge flat.
Without thinking,
you call in the tabby of Clubs.
They come with a web and steamroller for him.
They were weigh of particular, uniformed;
there were deuce of them,
their pickup dig, with a cage.
He was hide in the green goddess. It was fatten
you bill his eyeball. He understood.
He was trembling.
After they lease him, you begin to have regret.
Years fatigue, you commemorate his addle-head body
scrambling to progress to the others.
Even at this minute, your heart
is joint too small; your fist sweat.
