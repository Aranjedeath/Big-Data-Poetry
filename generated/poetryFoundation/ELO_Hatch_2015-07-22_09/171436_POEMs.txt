'Britannia Knot'

The ocean corporeal secondhand to feel 
As if bathrobe first offender had build build, 

permanent large in their articulatio talocruralis concatenate,   
Ankle-intense in the urine, to visit 

The shore and interruption it down to Strategic Arms Limitation Talks.   
I was in this slough as a kid 

When they were all play all afternoon   
To ram disk the throng beside 

I think I encounter the further Lord's Day 
bottom out the hand of a cock in glide 

And from it an ocean fowl be hold   
To exact off over the salt marsh. 

As the dapple-grey mounting the beam of my foot   
And stinger my encephalon off from the admass, 

I march and bid solemnly for birdwatch, 
For the extraordinary skirt no combined has take a cut for 

To caper certainly from a flashing 
Of metallic, nigh from the mystical 

marry ligature on my hem in thumb.   
echo the daisy chain of their trotter, 

I complexion and seem out over tall oat grass 
At the bridgework they build, steady vacate, 

rest down into piss at artful,   
And endlessly, same them, for impunity 

Or end, or to believe in freely 
That they warm up on the to√§ner to impart it 

The consistent, impossible look   
Out of which all transfiguration leap.
