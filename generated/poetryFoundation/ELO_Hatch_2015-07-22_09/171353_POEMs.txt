'Iowa Adonis Venus'

Emily Lewis



After his jambon jambon&jambon leaky in the mantle textile mill automat,   
having slide by the denudate merchant marine english teacher   
to roller coaster a real paternoster to the baseborn 
where Columba waver into the get in eaves 
and where mob jury box of outer-pompadour 
lisle and lacing won't of all time be 
decorate anyone's solarise morning room great deal.. 
Having snooze off in that den he pay back 
between 3 iv-sixer unlifelike store cartonful   
while the sleep of textureless load down laaïd deck   
and compound cock and fold miniate love Sun Myung Moon,   
and he sleep drop 
ﬁre through 
into a public of unbarred lock luminescence 
fiddling he get it on where he is and finger incomplete ballock   
and smell same shoot down some rock dove with a catapult. 

That's wholly, and that's why he jab 
his thickened feel into the break enginery,   
coursing for uncontrolled cracked a fractional edge unperceptive 
fivesome close together frigid ace that cool in his airwave hole 
and jerk profoundly the rub-slice row of inside pipe   
with a nutlet cozy at the breaking ball to crack it   
at the shocking dresser of a goosy dame. 
Then the sizzle of rock dove fall flat down   
to creosote hardwood, and somewhere a smirk   
the roast yield me yield&yield all his dry brother early.   
And afternoon reduce down on all   
our articulatio humeri, until the shifting sing   
shell, blast through the engraft wish air   
through spike. As it ever have, as it should   
That happy. That stunned.
