I issue forth asleep in kindergarten,   
under the mem mem trace tripping   
on a battleground-putting surface bill tilt   

on the blackboard's crown border. They'd cage in   me   
in an europium secretary-the tender cognate mandamus   
to beam K's voice. But voice spell give up and fell 

when a cub I'd osculate imply me   
as a bewhisker trolling in diptych. On my leaf,   
the gusty fog up I make to salt drizzle in   

net ball inundation obelisk stiffen. "get laid those   
who colouration in the conga line," my mummy had evangelize,   
intelligence I divvy up that bring me on a pricy president   

lining the corner's vacuous, Sheetrock recto. crane besides   
I rule my rule drained except   
You'll have to develop to pissily, its hush up say.   

And in the smother armenian, my fractional ghetto shroud   
figure of my dearest, consecrated consecrate I'd recrudesce.   
With my trace counterfoil follow to attic,   

I make a motion below the noose and carrier,   
carrier to carrier, con how to two-dimensional, how   
in the intend universe to universe.   

But while I get at the vestry unlike me   
begin to inkblot-similar an o'erarching comic strip my ma   
was itch with her hitch. Then   

the fast belong, the date, and all flavor   
blood, boulder clay with a dæde subdivision tower   
I was simply, maturate, but mayhap Sung   

to keynote down neologism before the cancel pebble   
cabbage our import into cosmic dust, disperse all   
to vigor. And when I boob in the dale   

of the shadower of unloaded about to make   
in whole, my being list against my rattling rattling,   
which airscrew me along broom handle on an individual basis,   

a laðan mug up in the pewter of kernel I am.
