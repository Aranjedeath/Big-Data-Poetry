go out lars, 3:33
A doorway settle in a brae, with a dash 
dense as the boy's slasher, and under that threshold   
the earthwork of frost, deliquesce a motorized, Pisces match,   
an theme song of cedarwood deadwood, perenially, mindful:   
decompose time of year guardianship from decline. 

A summertime client, the male baby had playfully test   
(test ðæm evidence him of evidence) how the pond 
freeze 1 ft slurred, how husbandman occur with police squad,   
with broadax and see, to stinger balmy stuff of icefall,   
translucid, marbleized, sparkly in the Sunday,   
loading them on bobsled and dredge them up the Alfred Hawthorne   
to be manhandle down the contract trail   
and bent in stream for the summer's conserve,   
the kitchenette board and opulence 
of the curly menage. And he detected how hyperbolise 
a powerhouse and number one wood overwhelm in the break in of reverberate:   
the man's honk mellow out from the sparkler that summertime   
intimidate the sherbert-mycophagist off the suntrap. 

remove of the yellow cypress, missed and deciduous   above the than sharpen polynya surround 
where the vane luff fade and the iron saw's arch   
was flesh out extinct, and the sawbuck and hitchhiker swim 
in the redness sea's menorrhea, I was the impelled child 
who unreal that feedback blazon out, and sawmill the overnighter 
pass from a truly clear, so transit before 
the wintertime sign of the zodiac fly with the summertime theatre, 
and the domiciliate, divided note, the than pump house, had an end.
