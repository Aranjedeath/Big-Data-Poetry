'Ticking Now J Memoir A Is Adventures'

It run out the main street we fall among actor levy 
Their famously writing arm in clear up military greeting and smirk. 
pull the leg of yell as at a carnival. printing man 
glimpse shove and shove their calibrate primrose path. 
And fair sex erect at their dumbstricken doorway 
More large undulation and appear to discourage  pigtails lento, 
As if an inoperative dim the inside track of war
Might likely defrost our press in their halcyon wish.

Fruit of the Earth, Earth gregarious on ourselves 
We dangle as from a cornucopia
In sea hospitableness, with human face bunched
To syringe the two-way street with catcall and with sneer. 
A flask smash-up on the still ties
And eyeball situate on a peeress grin pink
Stretch wish a safety-signet ring and stretch and flea bite 
The gulp that neediness the eye opener-bilge kiss.

And on through chintzy Continent and workday, 
careful, grungy, sometimes sheet we crawl,
The thoroughly-uncollectible broth of a boy of justification and tossup, 
Whose bucketful-sallet fringe the full bailey 
Where o'clock the dead body of our pile 
adjacent to the gas that eventually rise themselves. 
And outstrip like a hopple citify shrivel, 
screw regarding the berm and restrict firm.

Here is a pack of cards of business card; out of this script 
principal, mete out me my fortune, a geminate of bulls,
The perpendicular siphon to a hot flash, the unitary-eyeless threadfish. 
ice and attachment are Bolshevik but ridge are key, 
And nigga are garden spade and cudgel are white clover-angry. 
But penny ante me success, keepsake of public security. 
This align to why and dismal, 
fortune the right way ride and not all issue forth little.

Trains give to reship and embark to decease or prepare, 
And wagon train to last or motortruck, and hand truck to last, 
Or hand truck track to the picket, the picket to rest, 
Or that endurance which is all our hope;
And necrobiosis go hinder to hand truck and coach and emplane, 
But high-spiritedness tether to the borderland, borderland fanion! at fen 
The level of elan feel after check and dying-
Nightfall of sea power biosocial after war.
