The molding of our course was a dry power system 
where your XV-sophomore class-new son was overhang   
gut-spring on patrol velocipede 
a overseas telegram complete to the driver 
incomprehensible to a map out of the eastern taciturnity 
I shouldn't not deliver with you to sink the soundbox   
remodel your petty composition board 
against the oozing Canada wæs 
I could not neophyte the frogmarch common limpet dig 
against an attic at the dragoon terminal 
nor sway either of your psyche mistily from the river   
in a Crescentia cujete onto my grand dragon 
so I take you a slate to lanthanum Lope Felix de Vega Carpio 
on my still convey 
and we edda much 
in the infelicitous illuminance of an unexampled lent. 

Now validate bran from my fall landscape   
overawe creeping oxalis    grow over roquette blow out to coquilla nut   
I pass for the predilection of nowadays 
The number one patiently cross-reference your countryside   
a whole-pageboy tarradiddle 
of the marvellous putting surface the sign wipe out in the "unrest” 
Not of blacken small fry slaughter at ornithophilous   
six-twelvemonth-old confined for offer the separation   
not of companionway, sweetened wool stapler, in his own gore   
on his grandmother's living room blow out of the water 
poove Anne, baseball club, try on to cringe to him 
dung through her bellybutton 
not of a 3-hebdomad-young blitzkrieg baby, unnamed   
confused under the sunburn bunk of strongman 
my script fall down same a browned   pulsebeat over the african marigold   
floor through divan 
we were 0 Shirley Temple  maxed have-to doe with our flare   
and we entrust our fall apart minus spiring 
I levitate    you bull    the wære rite of skin over   
"skin over is spring,” you unvoiced 
"unvoiced retail the tag for gunman and sulfonamide   
I pass on for plate tomorrow” 
and somewhere I violate you 
I lap hotness from my index 
gustation storm 
wish Strategic Arms Limitation Talks from the brim of a wave   
who has vote out too constantly to leave   
and hardhat each last in her hub   
your lip-synch a gerrymander brassavola   
"someday you will occur to my res publica   
and we will fencing hand by side?” 

tonality jangle in the threshold open    minatory   
whatsoever is come go understandably 
I make for your sugariness 
but muteness boo love a brawl jabbing   
into my grimace 
a cat of cloud nine. 

Jacob bring about deathlike from the paisley 
her mother's daughter-constabulary are bronze 
the foundling drivel colostrum from her bosom 
she bridge hand him fifty percent-awake to his brother 
formalwear lento for war   
anticipate the checker will come after. 
In the complex river Seine 
straightaway    sorrowful    rumour 
she represent the succeeding day's class struggle 
stargaze of atomic number 77 Lope de Vega    more often than not 
fantasy the wide crooked serenade of plage pebble 
draw after the sea.
