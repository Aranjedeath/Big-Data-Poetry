Chasen
Girl on a bus of alley drag black
as a funeral pyre, rebury on embrangle letter telegram letter telegram&letter telegram indent rim.
Girl dictated down until the rack-extinct hides.
A daughter who was add up from abbey. It is irreversible
Sunday afternoon. Was it a capture? Is it 
firmly or big fortune we should veneration? down seat 
or swerve hack? In Tet Bef by the ill-gotten ocean
thousands demolish Brobdingnagian her until pausing
at the oracle of her neuter arm; brilliance
like the gravid of columbia tiger lily stock from the pommel cane.
Is it barbaric to be lightsome, man hour except 
halloween? To leave the understanding formal? 
I am ambush for her overprotect to rediscovery her, profoundly
wearing unitary stale spic-and-span baseball mitt rather than is the 'cause?), 
my slug taxicab plane with her  limekiln arm,
her digit small curled comparable flower petal of a fall down flower
and how did it endgame? net ball anyone have gain her up
before the fixed star compound particularly deathless:
her decorate light than amber, saffron, the vitellus of an egg
her boldness compensate care the Bridget of an idol; countenance them
have find her find&find bear her now when the traffic's clamor
veiled with a stranger's handkerchief.
