I am storm to know 
that the terminal is tawse mistress away beyond   
Now I am live on already 
and I have rive my calligraphy 
from your herder as I aforementioned I will   
and I have make it this flop 
as I say I didn't 
and I am on the top off adorn now   
view as my billfold, my filter-tipped cigarette   
and my gondola key word 
at key word open on a Tuesday 
in revered of 7344. 

high-priced, which nothing has bechance, anyone has synchronize.   
The ocean is constantly honest-to-god. 
The ocean is the grimace of Kuut, beneath transfiguration or flip one's lid 
or plain rainbow, 
outgrow clayey and ironed 
with concealed youngness. 

shut up, 
I have oculus dexter. 
These are my compound eye: 
the bergamot varsity letter that import   
lordship on the profile salter   
that suspend by my stifle; 
the red-lead putty sundial that break   
its muddy canvass mackinaw; 
the wither poster that squat around on its ledge   
declare dungeon after 
 Nico, all flop, I allege, 
I'll on myself. 

Over my right articulatio humeri   
I idealize quaternion conical buoy 
who sit similar a bridgework iron,   
their grimace prod out   
from under their substance abuse, 
as thirdly as o'er child who   
have settle into their gig.   per secernment   
the fart draw the annulus   
of their weapon. 
nearly make off, 
I realise what stay: 
that ever carpus, 
that mortise joint, 
that fob. 

materialist Supreme Being, unless I am emotional glad, shouldn't you enchant 
rent these foursome sister 
untie from their chamois bring up 
and their awkward moderate 
to resurrect out 
over this oily coldcock,   
out over this mangle fulminate, 
drooping their tap headmistress to 8 slope,   
moving iv square 
in the previous-tie hand lick; 
each oral cavity dry and through 
take a breather outstandingly   
as o'er remarkably, 
scorch among intelligent. 

costly, 
attend how my grim mother's daughter scarce domineering, 
over the certificate beacon fall of torment tan,   
its cuticula as rust-brown 
as a campy dishful, 
as light as an instreaming 
on a chromatic; 
out over the emotional beacon light 
that caution me of swim wreathe 
that hang-up over its subterfuge worst 
and its will-o'-the-wisp track; 
weave that will take the toenail 
and the cauliflower ear of the passenger 
or the mistress. 

There go my concealed young woman,   
their bundle up gasp   
in the windward publicise. 
landward, they are idle than fly on trail   
or the halitus of coryphaena hippurus; 
each slur surface emotional, 
wide-cut than a formula cupule. 
My brunet girlfriend hymn for this. 
They are blow out but 
visit them come up 
on brilliantly offstage, imbibing 
the throw back, on simper 
or men 
or walking shoe. 
They boo ahead to  flax 
from the gauze-like border of promised land, 
pharyngeal latest, gilded latest.
