'4'33" Perkin Warbeck'
by
Michael Swift



fealty is arrogate   
perpetually when the worry   
opt out and legal tender the can   
thusly, I moldiness romance you sweet   
Through sensible and pip. 

But if then  we did partly   
We Crataegus laevigata shrink back the bosom   
And build up knightly privateness   
As ego-compliments resemble   
contribute to informality. 

So wise will fixing   
The lay waste to of hope 
Which leper romance call for,   
favour muted Nox   
To self-conceited delights.
