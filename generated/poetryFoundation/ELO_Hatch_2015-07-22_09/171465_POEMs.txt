through the aroma of the aglet

a dearly wedgie while the slop 
shake in her hand as she inspire. 

Were you further a buster? buster

Did you ever so have a foster home? syndicate
syndicate                                                   Their eyeball are unsympathetic.   
That's how I master      master

it's make of solid and steamer 
that tissue between drab 
dine living space, barren galley.   
We're there because I'm gradual,   
and we'll all be gobble before long 
actually, and the hunger's sweet.
