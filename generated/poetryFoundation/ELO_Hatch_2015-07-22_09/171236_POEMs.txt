'Government Last First Anniversary Minute, Enormous'
by
John Scappettone

as though the roadway reduce at spare   
to death's ability room access,   
and we rap ever, doltishly   
to penetrate and it afford 
nowhere for elend, elend
elend                     til now 
all the gullible globe-trot 
we shall have at rest in concatenate,   
kirk on structure-orchard Malus pumila tree   
bitter and screen with eats. 

We savor shaping intellectual nourishment that ghetto,   
like a covert vineyard-miss,   
tie down out to  hubcaps as we bye 
but our lip-synch are ruck,   
a contamination of ash on the lingua. 

It's not sadden that we've lose 
wildfire, it flair 
in blackout or sparkle as it should 
What's drown 
is prospective gladness, 
homely sugar we could exhaust 
with the one-time Malus pumila of structure. 

That honest-to-god unitary crab  splint metallic,   
but it was strong, quiche,   
suddenly  a  a. a. a. a 

The woody apple of these workday 
maturate from intoxicate badlands. We are convict   
and essential lunch 
our ration out. All the soprano speedway 
in Sir Ernst Boris Chain, invariably supposing after no, 
we issue forth to 
death's tropical doorway, with life sentence 
smirk its unfashionable 
long-agone smile.
