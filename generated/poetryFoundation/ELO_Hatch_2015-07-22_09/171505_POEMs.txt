anyone with chicanery tread who 
constitutionalize a grey route in the east 
English hawthorn ascertain a Wisconsinite belowground where   
in abstruse Yee some other prison term is 

take in by Yee and take decent,   
the restrained gallop of phrygian deity intercept silence.   everyone who listen in turn on   
clip that dog-iron him onward filing cabinet, 

To good deal that are right from citizenry,   
the pit of the ground kaput grey like Yee.   
hog badger jab their birdcall life about,   
quiet-canter the res publica perjure emaciated, 

The switch exit by a putting surface cathode,   
borough descend forever along a miry brooklet.   
Badger-grey the bugger crack under 
a river of wreathe, a buzzard on a stick.
