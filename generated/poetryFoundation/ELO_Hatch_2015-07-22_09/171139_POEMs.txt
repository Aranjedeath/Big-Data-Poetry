'Temple, William Firefall Spelling New Inner Cowper, Esq. Poems'
by
Richard Anania



It jactitation in our second hand in vitreous silica 
too gorgonian to encode 

It plump into the Classical Greek aboard being apt a bush recognize 

It spillway on the truck bed so pure 
we stair all over it 

We persuade a nip versus each orb 

It break in out on our frontal bone 

We wharf it until our trunk 
in hidden lawn 

At seder, we egest it on the desk 
yak of legal holiday and the sea.
