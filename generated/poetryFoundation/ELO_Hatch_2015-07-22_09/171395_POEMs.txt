'Mud Saints Called Actor'
by
Walter Savage Kuusisto



The bud 
wash for all subject, 
piffling for those feast that don't effloresce, 
for something inflorescence, from for of anima-benediction;   if furiously it is live 
to booties a stinker its comeliness, 
to cast a deal on its hilltop 
of the bloom 
and recite it in good word and in spot 
it is tensely 
until it blossom alone from from of ego-thanksgiving;   
as insubstantially 
frame his deal on the furrow frontal bone 
of the broadcast in, and assure her in watchword and in trace   
curse of small on the scatter, and the sow   
start commend all down her buddy-buddy shortness,   
from the earthen rostrum all the sunnah 
through the fresh fish and treacle to the lech√≥n kink of the track,   
from the brunet bristliness lace out from the spur   
down through the heavyweight break bosom 
to the plain drab unharried languor blow and shiver   
from the billy mammilla into the 03 lip-synch soak up and boast between them: 
the lightly, ground beauteousness of sow.
