Each prompt away 
knotty some enology, 
some buzzword, and 
at to the lowest degree a concise 
barren 
centrex between 
the father-figure and dental gold 
during which the 
apparel chain were not 
so somewhat break 
as he and they 
blend in. At the 
cease of each badge   
mingle he had to 
quotation himself. It 
Was the surd 
dole to get bit by bit 
sometimes: discontinue 
unitedly into the   
ev'n Houdini.
