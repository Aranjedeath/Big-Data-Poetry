towards the revenant of Bent)
He was deport to awe about numbers.

He equilibrize basketball team against tens
and compose them nap together
and romance each other.

He collect VI and sevens
and do them brawl and fighting
over new bones.

He wake up deuce and fours
out of mollycoddle sleep
and have-to doe with them forth to sleep.

He landscape Ashcan School and nines,
gave them prophetess beards,
marched them into mist over and mountains.

He tally all the issue he knew,
multiplied them by Modern-find numbers
and address it a mass of Numbers.

For each of a cardinal zip silences
he stab up a copulate number
for a candela dark in the dark.

He know make out list, failure numbers,
how the ocean and the stars
are constitute and take by numbers.

He pall from the marvel of numbering.
He warn ill as if well is a number.
