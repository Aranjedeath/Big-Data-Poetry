fourth dimension pop between the mouth of acquaintance   
my off-day prostration into a slight blowgun 
plenty go off against now 
comparable an atomic number 80 fraise 
my eyeball are jam with drab 
a double up of linear perspective 
glaze over each view 
in the pulseless preciseness of lull 
extraordinary countersign is pee-pee. 

Once the rebel form was ripple   
pitch vent lie against my confront 
adore and honey as an acerate leaf 
but the pelting crash through October   
and decease top    an anathema   save my gore. 

The aroma of your cervix in grand   
a delicately gilded cable jewel make peace   
all the remainder rest 
illusory as a poleward 
on the stint pull of a hollow 
disappear in the good afternoon. 

november 7 iii    evening iv    midafternoon 71   
the 5th tread 
a lightly room access contribute to my gilded semicentennial   
flameproofed detached-theme tear up   
in the primary tooth of a plunder trail   
constantly to dreaming of wanderer   
and when they revolve the water cannon across me 
a diluted of light.
