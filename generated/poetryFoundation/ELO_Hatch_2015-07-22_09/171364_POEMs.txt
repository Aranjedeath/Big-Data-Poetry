They have put heavy their thudding canister shoebox,   
claw and indent, 
splash with dump of knock and unbreathable;   
and their dry-functioning, cog pipe   
of alizarine flushed, chromium-plate vernal,   
Zn black, and chromatic; 
their ampule fifty percent saccharinity of atomic number 57 araroba;   
nub of rise lead pencil; 
worn brushing with chopper-bite quill;   
and have do in manner and with decorate   
into the large dust of dam, wild damask rose,   
jonquil, pansy, meeting house,   
on teapot, cocoa corporation, 
intervertebral disc and claret cup, the down-to-earth Haviland gravy boat   
centerfold same a cosmic 
on the ovalbumin braid Lord's Day drapery,   
as if their psyche were translate 
and the academia had been nobody but inflorescence.
