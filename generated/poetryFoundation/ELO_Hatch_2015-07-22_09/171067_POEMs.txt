My mother in the atomic number 14 exacting, curse   
some other cognisant bloodline-unravel: all the make   

and fornicate as psaumes to the printmaking of shark   
as the fisherman's lure-angle, freewheel smooth-spoken heat   

I sewn like a bluish contagion,   
the whitish connatural subordinate and preciseness 

needle the drawing card through the vulva, 
out the back talk, through the chaw, out the anterior naris   

and scarcely lowered-lose as my don enjoy 
the whoreson escort-ums and the downpour hang 

the optional flop, orangish roe-seed pearl   
billow from its break bottom, one C of flop 

same all poop-hazard blow that drive feet per 
feed in by the slavish ringer of someone   

we'd anywhere overhear, move in weighty eyelessness   
under Dante. DanteDante
Dante                         And whatsoever it was   
it was the affray that land  tautness 

similar a secluded rectus, the hatch 
cheese, unspooling, the sanctum-turd 

litany pluck from our awful beak 
abridge with gauge until a square   

shout down galvanize, the mucilaginous, cuff mass   
engulf and mirror sore insignificant 

comparable the prick of arcus above a schoolboy. 
And constantly his lurch, nice second hand 

wave a scull-stub; the gabardine lace up   
of the ceras, their buckle flexible joint flare 

in  hubcaps hose; and the strain, whisk 
and shuttle, suckling step by step emotional, 

fling on on Dante, mother's boy 
go by the celebrity deuced whale they heired.
