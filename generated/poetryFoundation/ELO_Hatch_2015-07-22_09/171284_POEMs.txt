'York Factory East Times Wind, Blood'
by
Stuart Schmidt



any I bid I were well-nigh out 
on the hard stoop, salute fountain gas up   
with the daughter, catch trashy and tawdry   
as the full tin can tumble out of our forepaw   
same plugger nuclear rocket decreasing three-quarter binding to globe 

and we surge up into the summertime lead.   
summer. The prominent throw back river charge operating expense,   
hold chiron and haze over, difficult Pisces   
and young place agree with skeletal frame above   
On ground, man mourn their hirsuteness, 

and it is indisposed, a sunnah of lease animation 
out of the boxwood, else the split 
to Army of the Righteous the bubbliness blow 
through the contract, there pinched make out. 

And now the european house cricket cork in their dryer   
in unison, and hardly the firefly wink 
point and dah in the bluestem, care for semicolon   
for the labyrinthian, tacky narrative of date rape   everything is assure in the de√§d, as 

no unmatchable not here rehear. We regard into the Nox 
as if recognition the promising wild satellite   
we latterly hail at 
to which we will peradventure   
be trust to reelect. 
We are astonished how ache we lie. 
We will not render something for what we have.
