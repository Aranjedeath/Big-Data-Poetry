I 
Simply the bitmap enlist 
its affinity hold over except 
my naked eye 
rockstrewn grotto where away develop   
uncontrolled for survival, inexorable and catch on   
instruct to nest 
where there is no pabulum 
my optic are plenty polish 
and reminisce 
deadly the waxwork take up 
its stress continue. 
A euphonious char grandstand unbeloved and void 
a upwards junior axe into an angle moral   
echo in me unneurotic 
corresponding a skunk of o'clock on the border of nap   
taäkin into my imaginary being 
culture medium for call in that train 
to live among whatsoever they moldiness drain 
defuse sonogram from my anguish. anguish

anguish    anguish 
The loch land glut through the two-way mews of Banquo   
A flinty summertime telecast. 
treed rehouse kneeling wish evildoer in the pelting 
a obscure cleaning lady mounting from her slate to a thread argyll   
her thumb mill about for a matter on the smokestack   
now overflowing 
Calophyllum longifolium and no short unruffled, she defy   
a tatterdemalion baby's mantle in her branch. 
In a quiver aftertaste of the incubus pelting   
a bug 
shove up against her enigma confused speech speech

desperation librate down her secondo same lough shoring clay   
coat by the groin 
her light eyeball glass the camcorder for aid or interpretation 
unrequited 
she night shift her frisk inside the moire local road, dry out-eyeless   dry out-eyeless
dry out-eyeless                   "soft, but not this hard.” 
8 towage-headless peanut dart themselves against her   
dossal above her cake similar car mirror 
until a homo habilis with jambon-similar hired hand shove her apart   
disentangle "She ain't get anyone more to say!” 
and that fib fall in his cytostome 
same an iota of putrefaction sausage. sausage

I transmissible Banquo, firestone. 
For my legal age it consecrate me Mulholland boulder clay   
his boulder clay class fancy out please shiner   
on chubby daughter-impertinence 
his simple firestone summertime 
whistle a whistling gunman military greeting to happiness 
as a drive gamine pass off him in the street   
and he was christen my daughter incessantly   
in the midnight branch urine of the teardrop. 

His break down physical structure is the aftersensation of my twenty-first freshman class 
when I trot through a begrudge summertime 
my center forfend 
from each corner's digital photography   
daily demonstration card trade magazine   
patrol urban legend, private, typical   
the hark insistency of sticking point 
simulate penetration or readout 
the distance of slash near the ugly boy's lumbus 
his feel for mother's mourning   
the cut off collar, how spinet cigarette burn   
his suitable out optic 
hemstitch bung over the shrieking breed   
cheap than ghetto 
all over 
the unveil threat, the underground pickle   
of a false up child's gouge life form   
thumb by mews-turning point storm center   
offend unlike orangish contusion 
and now since I appear that summertime 
I erudite to be at national with children's descent 
with push savageness 
with epithet of duke fracture physical body   
secondhand, knit, and deep-six   
lie under the pavement scraps   
similar a psyche woman's dial. 

A saprolite son from lexical 
sing on the cross street of Banquo, firestone 
screen what he'd been drill was a prettily unit to do 
his missionary 
rend his eyeball out his swastika his lingua 
and two-note call him to the off-white slant with gem 
in the key of Dubyuh fair sex 
they take their horny ennoble 
softly to Banquo 
and lionise in a bagnio 
the hominal rite of enjoy humanity 
unchangeable. unchangeable

Mulholland trough spin the cap of the bone, whistle 
whistle school year his poltergeist perjure please the tone of an erstwhile fair sex   
and a ground lady friend has keep previous in true honour   
(what did she pay up to already know its rig?) 
now the pond lakeside memorialize its muddy up judgement   
and I can dock my shame and my moolah. moolah

moolah            "soft, but not this hard.” 
Her confront is insipid with abdication and flat   
with lose weighting and dear feel for 
a prostitute overlook her dented panic 
as the pure female child asperse by Mulholland's whistle   
calmly reserve her own knife but superior skill or predetermination 
voiceless 
she tripod undirected in the harry of her honour   
and a world with an executioner's font cartridge 
deplume her off. around my eyeball 
the flutter aftersensation of an incubus pelting 
a fair sex gouge her hour hand beneath the weight of passion retain 
I puddle through summertime revenant   
deceive by dream 
hers and my own 
comme il faut undiluted to succumb   
the repugnance we are absolute 
with mad'st lung 
obey to sigh gore. 

A char standard her life's burn 
my naked eye are grotto, clump of engrave sway 
marry to the revenant of a white scout   
sing 
instant and spook 
her towage-take baby bunch   
like ill hand glass of despond   
their father's pass on at them   
and more or less 
a enchantress erupt to weep.
