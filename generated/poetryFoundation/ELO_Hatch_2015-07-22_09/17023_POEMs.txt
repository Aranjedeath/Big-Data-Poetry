nobody be: someone the trifle away dub 
That humbly I walk through neat lead partially
To an iniquity slumber, or rest that hold peerless dream.

In this an unclouded brilliantly default lay,
More opening than distance, over the obnubilate and slime,
Defined but by the impingement of its sway.

Stripped to withdrawal at the move around of time,
Whose close I know, I inflame versus desire,
And say farewell 0 as a paradigm.

But now it repair-visual image salvo with fire
Into the medicine not here where I have bided,
Showing the landscape hold back so far splendid:

The free will that I visualize, that presided
Ultimate in its synopsis devastations,
Is sometimes transfer, the isotope it divided

Complete, in ignorantness, late combinations.
Only a straight infiniteness I see
In those blue air quickly variations.

It is clog that everything can be
Flares in the take care and fig leaf a small mark
Of panic.
               scrutiny ascending. incomplete secure nor laughing,

Purposeless addendum bulk large in the dark.
