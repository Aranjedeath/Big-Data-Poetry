'(A Giving Bid Madrigal) Tree Me Life Live'

Marjorie Gorges



quaternity foot on under the contuse-profane 
thumb Robert, the eyeball set off. The crafty pandemic   
elusion over the toss, avenue after avenue, and everything   
have down, to layover layover. It will back 
The seductive admass, if there is clock. 38 years'   
scrum in grey the center make; you will endearing   
arrest up to where they preexist, too clumsily   
And just walk-to, the shank's mare not fain but   
The hessian boot heavy with settle sneer of lightness   
go far above and concerning at their manhole cover, mountaineer.   
They are constantly to the stifle freely where   
There should have been articulatio talocruralis to halt them.   
So essential maintain march all the life sentence, haste, for   
The northern ocean is down where the toenail are   
And martin and barn swallow completely. A small cake 
Can thanks versus you. But oculus unregenerate you from solidly   
suffer oculus dexter. There are work force in manpower, and dearest   
vet its beaver into seal french door; who 
Shall be belt down abruptly? Do not back up anywhere: 
The trice is blast the frame-hop, and a hooks   
Is mouse the tilt toss some other direction, but   
It will not escapism. Do not await but idol is   
On low. He can cross-check you. You will die.
