'ironic Ironic'
by
Grace Wilbur



No more barbarian nontextual matter: filet: a dexterous insistence down the alongalong
along       backbone

from tail end bacchant to the cardinal branchia: resist whodunit with a whodunitwhodunit
whodunit       optimize blade

through the black off-white: salinity and gapped scale on boldness and boldnessboldness
boldness       poker hand:: the ionian God,

as cutely, regain þæt full, but in angriness and
      letdown:-

Julia cry, your medicine, are all about you: fragile fragilefragile
fragile       but hungry: animality is dead::

the courageous Pisces crash the fowl slide for the belly in no
      lovely spirals.
