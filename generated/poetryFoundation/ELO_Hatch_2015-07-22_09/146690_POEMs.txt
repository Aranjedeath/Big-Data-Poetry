In the notochord of the enchant-corner, in a release, the indulge    
cuspid and  textual are incautiously blackness,   
by as split up corn and sorry in no   
slope server leave: whole   
an adze; incomplete a posthole digger, in its break   
haft a cocozelle scarcely of the will   
to toil and snap. And the nail polish ahem   
are tripping as armor plate-pecker, and the colorlessness colorlessness from   
calcium chloride, to pearl, to spend a penny on coke, to   
solarise on swimming hole-chalk enclosed with sprig   
and break off-cancelled rollerblade-impeller. extraordinary sandbag   
is prefer the bob of a tusk  foamline   
on my grandmother's what-non in an intaglio on my mother's   
chest in my father's bungalow in my straits,   
I conceive it's our daughter's, but the dime bag Hermes   
jumble the slipcover of our scout and male child, out   
maintain them in vain with the billet that warn   
lamb loyalty, Plees Giv Me   
A bagful of Brooklyn. I center over the sherd,   
a skeletal frame-darling-simply who shouldn't bewilder out   
these moral dry pint of  sphered breastmilk,   
or the astuteness, with its sepulchral bottom,   
and its cupola, unruffled and harbor,   
establish in wrath, elute in silvern   
when the beak limewater. From through its  hubcaps   
are a leaflet-nest of seamount upper side   on a yellow-brown crevasse, where in off   
summertime the pinnacle heliopsis wedding night   
for a midafternoon-pennant crowfoot, upland flare,   
Shooting-headliner, rose-colored fag chinese lantern,   
emollient sack, saccharify Scoop.
