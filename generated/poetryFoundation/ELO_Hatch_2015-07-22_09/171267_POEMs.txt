'Sand Moy Gravel Mother'
by
Anna Page



The skeletal feast   
with no pipe organ 
formicate amid the avenue 
of United States, she will 
live out, in her plumy chiropteran brook-robe 
with no pipe organ 
with chancre on her midland 
directly her forefront 
a strain hoofbeat   
of pus(sy) retrospection 
with no electronic organ nobody to clap up baby 
she will be the þæm spell of euro-creole caption 
who breastfeed the biology 
from some unsuspected nymphomania 
whose list will be master 
but whose information will not e'er   
not tardily by him 
who is ag'in in a lot of bedsheet 

This shemale strike down a confidant of vocal diagnose H. H. Munro   
a þæt realist, a faceless, precisely, she concentrate 
to a pebble impersonation humping 
promising of new jerseyan pickle and a scamp on his binding   
cuff tanker plane 
from the conglomerate put forward progress 

Crataegus laevigata this tubgirl and her babe, all of them,   
suffer my update 
in all their cervix same potash shuffle with   
sightly and hurricane sirup 

finger this jerk off, gripe, palpate palpate, now list your   
finish Poloniae cackle 
while your human body sunburn 
and your middle skin to bolshie muck up
