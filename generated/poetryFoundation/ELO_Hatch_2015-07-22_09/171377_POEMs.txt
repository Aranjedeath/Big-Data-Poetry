squinched through eyeball-twat in our balaclava helmet,   
we pitch regarding rob roy conning tower   
hump against the roll, deuce hood motif   
enchant in the black and white, dribble furlough 

of may apple, as we've set for class. The opaque, sago 
steadfast lacewood jostle a vulgar Dec 18 corner 
appear to volume big, slant under the shoulder girdle 
and alone spotlight in trey coloring material. Once in Jan,

we've roughhouse in roughhouse, fresh hallelujah arouse late chirk.   
ovalbumin offset tongueless prevision of tight surprise; 
some drawl they've detected wraith groan above this foreland,   
bravely a potter's steppe. No couple Edward Durell Stone are the rushed,

will blind the lag in a back up whistle. if only trek away through gumption that's rise in high spirits, 

expression tip-tilted to screen the whirlpool whiteout, 
in new masquerade party, we sing to make hint-swarm stratification   
and vanish, and straightness acrost, and acrost,   
my get off, there's insolate in the curve of your arm.
