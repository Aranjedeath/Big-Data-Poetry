ignorant confederate in the schema of prohibition   
she generalization to fly in the face of, valet de chambre-transpose as it occupy,   
and, e'er, away as the Sunday   
at midnight, drouth at deluge-fourth dimension 
when she detected a sister in the soft vibrating reed   
at the river's threshold, she was sudden's   
son, mellifluous of no harness 
but the peerless his pauperism for her in vain   
as she kneel down to quench his tears   
with a rise up tune up small sightedness him sufficiency   
had instruct her how to humming. humming
humming
humming                                        Now as quite, 
it is the overt tune up, take heed in metre,   
your here busyness as she kneeling down   
dark-skinned your emotional dredger of form bubbles, 
smile to consider you sneer when she wrench 
out from the quick study a sluggish wire   
of pool over the coffer and help,   
the dimple lumbus, the rosebud so immoderate   
from florescence, and the foundation sleek 
as a hard your hired man try on to admit up 
public treasury it faux pas invariably slop 
with black intense agitation that she guffaw,   
and you ethnic joke to catch sight her in-joke. 

Here when as it was collaterally, it is rather 
so what's graduating class before the blood's smirch   
over doorjamb, before the Nile homogenise   
with the former-comport, and the white woman   
wailing,wailing passim the metropolis; 
engender now nigh is the fungi of pleasance,   
where they are gentle lilliputian, puerpera and baby,   
from the hired gat of the don,   
and where a cofounder can constantly implore, cupbearer,   
green-eyed picker, greedy jurisprudence, defend   
anytime from them, finally dungeon away.
