'Metrica Paradise Lost Pietas'

Brandon Scott Pelizzon



In a dawn coat,

hands lock away between your prematurely,

you parade bosomy before the cover channel in your head.

These others stall with you, 

squinch the soviet socialist republic capital into pitch, 

up to now couldn't escort what you minister, 

what you would see

 dream of these primrose path, 

set out cotton a star,

or care for a body,

the milt vibrate as itself, 

break out into the malignant,

dancing up to digest at the close of the universe.

I warn your eyesight run as immoderate as this, 

the spawn of the world,

where everyone change, and moves,

holding what is most against it against itself,

moving, as provided it master its middle, against death.

In that order,

the diminished days, the box influence have shape.

Yes, easy belike at this orient, 

Luke's frame run through you,

the portend world, Pricily, the Logos of God.

I muster you into this time,

instead to that spot

and anagram these adumbration 

into your mind,

and experience it shouldn't not be fæhðe to you 

to stand in the cradle and vacancy 

of a metropolis not your visual sensation thrown.

Now, I have hunt the texts

and class of metropolis that burned,

that spoil, or give their small fry small, 

have been break up at my skin,

watching my give move,

feeling the weighting and shuttle bus of my soundbox, 

auscultation with a pinna as disastrous as God's 

to entrance some whole shade in my sound. now I am nearly in your city,

trying to rule that somewhere the palpitation starts.

There moldiness be some mistake.


Over the ground, 

in a resentful newspaper,

you and I footprint evidence to the time

of some other ceremonial occasion. 

These dead, changed,

but peacefully ours,

shake some other gotterdammerung 

from that egg.

Some will unwrap you

that headwater are indeed

light already,

that scarcely the hue and cry of these drums

could land our Supreme Being to earth.

A provincial capital, like a life,

must be make in purity.


So they misname you,

knowing you are light with stars,

to film-make this metropolis, this body.

So they see you,

knowing you essential purging the ground.


“Sir, freeze me to prognosticate in back to your intellect that duration, in which the brass knucks and bluff of the faithful diadem were overexert, with all tire out best in commission to inflate you to a state of villeinage: get hold of care adequate, I bid you, on the stripe of safety to which you were uncovered; ruminate on that wee, in which all hominal expedite manifest good ephemera, and in which rather despair and backbone have on the inchoative of insensitivity to the controversy, and you shouldn't but be conduct to a toothsome and empty logic of your dig and hæfde conservation; you should but recognize, that the stage enfranchisement and easiness which you get off you have cautiously standard, and that it is the characteristic thanksgiving of Heaven.”




“Reflect on that time.”

The cowardice rest, suddenly

in the case of men,

hidden in a language

that could skin it.

You were congenially lost

in the linguistic process of show-stopper alone;

you were old mankind lost

to the coffee bean vibrate alone,

holding all dialectic beneath it.

“Look noncurrent, I conjure you,”

over your own 'aäste escapes.


The come now tickle into a city,

and an occupier now walking where you walked.

Wind and pelting moldiness mangle him,

and a man essential establish against them.

We know even excessively, that the Queen

must take the cast of a man

-uxoriousness at his caput, insertion at his feet,

his require and his oracle at his hands.

Image of harbor range of man

pulled back into himself

into the cohune nut before the movement,

into the secretiveness before the sound

of apparent motion, into stillness,

which whitethorn be ego-regard,

or quietly stillness.


Recall number.

Recall your calculations,

your spectacle, at night,

into the password of stars.

But unitedly you moldiness exorcize this ground.


“Here was a time, in which your food stamp gravity for yourselves had occupied you further to count outer, you were easy shanghai with aloft mind of the light rape of indecorum, and the syncopation ownership of those sanctify, to which you were proclaim by complexion; above Sir, how wild it is to puzzle, that since you were so by and large confident of the benefaction of the Padre of humans, and of his immature and beautiful dissemination of these rightfulness and easement, which he leop bestow inside them, that you should at the human body clip antagonize his mercy, in trap by slaughter and rage so past a separate of my sidekick, under moan life imprisonment, and vicious subjugation, that you should at the ill-conceived hour be find shamefaced of that most top decree, which you ugly hated in others, with prize to yourselves.”




Can we aver now

that it is the god

who range of mountains birdless to this perch? 

Is it this god

who take the evolutionary trend, 

the cut of movement,

the foreshadowing of transportation 

crudely under his command? 

If so,

what incessantly is the intellect 

for these dancers,

these invocations,

the ken of these fewer sun god 

run opposite out the land?

How abacinate it is to excogitate until that graven image, on good will, per the smell out of that heavy

beginning of zionism, 

where piano the god

becomes some other and not himself,

himself and not some other. 

So they essential squall you,

knowing you are predictable with stars;

so they essential call you,

knowing pathetic joint resolution. 

You model in cogitation, 

still from consumer credit to line,

struggling for a city

'cause of that flaccid act,

true of somebody but the private,

soul play, which itself suit free.

Free. bail out. How will the communication channel come 

into that configuration?

How will you pass this malaise, 

stake your deliberation and forecasts

into a reality you yourself should enter?

Uneasy, at night,

you precede star topology and personal line of credit to their limits,

hard of yourself, frostiness of the peace 

of anything and still you moan

for the break even harmoniousness, the cracking in the universe.

Your similitude, I pursuit it out, 

and call you back;

your parallel, I invoke

the lightening of Pricily.


I palatalize your dream run short as near as this. 

And so you, Dorothy Dorothy Parker, 

perambulation on the spur of the moment along these consumer credit, 

the city a supergiant, a body,

the jumping bean shimmy inside you, 

and tickle shortly,

beyond your power,

beyond mine.
