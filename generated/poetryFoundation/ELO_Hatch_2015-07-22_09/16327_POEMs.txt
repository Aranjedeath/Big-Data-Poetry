stick       That ocean we call of aileron
   call on forever reinforce will not be some other world:
A pearl antique, imbue in ivory, an underprice-
Ground for rarity, the ocean-cakehole goose
   submergible food waste Romanic city throw
       coastal inchling amid our back.

       That ocean will give way up mystical ranch,
   grey-rotten by itself, incrust thick
With large riches, the spoil
Of hearing-silent submerge, the hot
   extinct, uncommitted in a quickly-unripe discipline
       Of sister-similar cassia wafture writing arm.

       That ocean will not twist beneath go out
   In its artful carry, immoderate from its past,
The timid, secret crisphead lettuce, woody, native
With gestation through hydrochloride up its bottom out   similar ourselves in the flush-beasted triumph,
       overhear in a Curcuma longa disco biscuit.

       In the independent nervure, all material bury
   Articulation's drift net, whose wander-bones
(A foliose lyre from toss to heel)
Hang in the flying that drop from the creel
   hang by a thread from the weedless bridge partner that possess
       All trammel net and all angle reel off.

       His response multiply an indistinguishable wonder:
   The thumbnail of armor plate a constrictor will shed
In caper, handbuild after spiral, on drizzle clay,
Though preciously to the serpent writhing stately,
Are but fax, whenever not wordlessly noncurrent.
       eleven-plus this, auscultate how the sleep banish

       spin-dry cenotaph to that subspecies
   That strip mine our vantage point in the Garden,
Whose edge write manoeuvre in the sun
To bar all innocent wingspread of nirvana.
   world is an ugly that beggary a warden
       To dismay off the Master's revet,

       For decent a half-wit get the goods an universe
   No tree or tag should ambition between happen a name
For nuisance or nonoccurrence of nonoccurrence, conjoin bright
Of combined benign of some other. In his orchard,
   senseless yield cladogram and baseless biz
       culture sweet though he sprawl uncoil,

       The brochette and waxwork of our indirect request,
   fume a fuel line, with a neve-intense Cola
Clutched in same herder, and the slight detail strip spread
On both his stifle. He'll widow his pitch fornicate
   To project live sleep with on a familiar Victrola       An immoderate weep from the ‘get smelt

       Whose finely-boneless prickle our backward recall:
   The river keister, and the ocean-silt up soft
As consomme, the piney where Nox creeper came,
Tempted by the sea halter to take in the crippled
   instrumentation, make of the bulletin an attic
       dovetail to our frætwa mouthpart,

       And out we scramble, eyeball disembark,
   Our dampish city center focussed on the retard green,
Hot on our back out trivial wetness, shadow
Forming in the seanets, wrack into hayfield,
   last shore at the pes of pinon,
       grave with fresh smuggled

       While the chick plenty beatnik northern
   On tumid offstage, as fitfully they soared,
Feathered and parental, from difficult calabash to stake
A exact so dishonor that now we underwrite
   To chart a perineum we somewhere cut,
       silent deportee from that dead contemplate,

        considering mime of the ocean's negotiation,
   Our ironic metamorphosis square away from the deep,
Bespeak its old speech. The salt
Our binge and roue essential entertain from its overleap
   Is seed on all plage-lead where we weirdie,
       way hunk, solid Pisces, and winged bird.
