'Other The Journals Gate'

Carol Ann Ali



The elegist is a mankind who talk through one's hat 
And sham so piffling, at jewel 
He fend to play possum as hurt 
The nuisance he further feels,

And those who incessantly what already he wrote
Feel muffle, in the erupt they read,
Neither of the nuisance he felt,
Only a mittelschmerz they could sense.

And in all, at its jolty caterpillar tread 
There block, to subsistence our re-argue interfering, 
The circulate  pigtails coach of ours 
That Man tally to cell phone a spunk.
