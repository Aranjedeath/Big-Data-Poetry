E. Tracy Howe



The universe is tardily of sacrifice; work, draft, my enjoy,
         my house is where we lay down our see-place,
         and heartstrings whatsoever I shall come to and scan
         from that face.

Lift, wind up, my deportee from my inner city;
         amity to stare, lifetime to listen in and squeal,
         exemption to discover to breakthrough to discovery
         that nakedness.
