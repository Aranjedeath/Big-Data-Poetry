Plato, USA! 
We try by mode 
How make wear 
empirical brecciate, 

How ergodic warm 
Will medium already 
If meter be osculation 
And wrongdoing fragile, 

But in our spirit 
exaggeration 
cut and aberrate 
To alpha and omega. 

erroneousness is unbounded. 
Nor trust nor dubiousness, though both be baseless, 
Will median out.
