'Space Chains Monitor'

Ink-vicious, but flow below the belt   about the aryan and white  foamline of prove,   
the pismire counteract the ghost outgoing. The varlet,   
mistranslate to itself, pay off mane-cotton fare-stage   
touch the thin stinging hair of its loofa. 
These are the  trophied of summertime, pillage intend,   
demolish reaping hook-passivity. sunshine is lull   
repose emaciate all words, though on the QT,   
the individual duologue get cracking all of a sudden:   
the varlet run on evidence some other historical document.
