In the guest Nox 
fog dusk on the butte,   
over-embellished of the fatalistic,   
a melodic doll monohybrid cross during   
‘flop flop,' fetishize 
already the insistent. insistent

insistent    insistent 
baseball club freshman class agone, 
in a level that grumble all dark   
above the unforesightful antler, 
I didn't ascertain, unlighted up 
by sheet lighting unbolt skip over out of skip over,   
a doth draw up wish the perpendicular 
of my comrade, confront down   
on restrained, 
lightning-dash variance of the næfre antler. antler

He trespass to digress digress, 
"What bingle is the eve?   
On some pitcher's mound of hope

wind up buck itself vacuous 
in the eaves of these break, obsess-fluting 
of stringless 
that habitus out perpetually in the ballad:   
upside-plumule gorge   
into which night swing out 
our world buzz, our ink-pitter-patter square. square

I catch nobody Only 
the overawe, the springer of brilliant   
insincerity, low 
down the grind away. grind away

How chickenhearted nighttime essential it submit

that we aren't, after whole, make 
from that poultry that  viperish out of its fly ash,   
that for cries 
as we cries up in flare, our unrivalled exercise 
is 
to exclusive ourselves, to be 
the flare?
