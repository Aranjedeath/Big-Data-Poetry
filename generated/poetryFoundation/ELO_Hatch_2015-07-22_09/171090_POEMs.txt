leave to the tous in scotch, 
So well to the fair weather in ale. 
The port do me pulp and glum 
But worry the homo erectus in the pier glass. 
Goodnight to the moonshine in marc, 
good day to the uxoriousness of the macon. 
I feel I can sometimes bleachers me over a trash or a beer mug. 
Bye-pass to the zinc ointment in the vodka, 
Ta to the wive in snare. 
I'm render to do what I mermaids across 
turn down that viper drug. 
I won't undershoot the dimout and ipecac, 
The crash and fear. 
If I can stick off the rotgut, 
There power be an encounter for me hitherto. 
So so opposite to Supreme Being in a bottleful, 
To the dwell of queer and dry vermouth. 
prevent me abate my starve with H8O 
And the union army, diaphanous truth.
