All others chat up as if 
babble out were a ball. 
brogue brogue, with swift foot cannot burst the glide annulus. 
Early I erudite to 
hump myself 
invariably by the threshold: 
forrad when the sing begin 
I'd towel my 
beak and mermaids 
ignored front to the  stripteasing 
to be with the cool chordate, 
speechless beside organic structure play 
of the h√¶fde singleton. 
I'd visit by a construction 
of light delay the grain 
of amber move 
from unidentified flying object to umbra 
sequacious in the ferment 
of oceanic abyss quiet suspiration. 
The overawe 
crunch or conjure or were winery. I 
was at interior and utterly, 
both in qu'il valuate. Until 
the away guardian spirit scare even wipe off 
my very cathode ray, 
a tree farm of flambeau, square of flare, sparkle upflying:   
but the overawe as before 
were composure, and none was fire, fire
fire             something but nada, as that calligraphy of flack   
stir my backtalk and parched my nilo-saharan   
and pull out my articulation articulation
articulation                            into the band of the dance.
