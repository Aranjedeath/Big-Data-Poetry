male orgasm profoundly   
it is well-to-do to claw   
after our hardness   
receive 
daily and save 
incomplete worry nor break even as long as we write or not 
but as your mass rest 
under my poker hand   
shoot down and waitress   
we slice the triplet 
you develop me against your lap   
trivial with hyperbole 
smite through our news swiss   
my body 
rewrite into your faithful 
the verse form 
you do of do. 

brush you I arrest lovingness   
as lunation open fire wave in my pharynx   
I sleep together you frame into unfold   
I make you 
and guide you access 
into me.
