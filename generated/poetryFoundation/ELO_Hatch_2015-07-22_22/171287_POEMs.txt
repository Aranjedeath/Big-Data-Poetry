descend skyward   
it is uneasy to heavy lifting   
after our bodywork   
get together 
gazette and instrument off 
incomplete brood nor gain supposing we write or not 
but as your personify turn 
under my hooks   
bear down and waitress   
we turn off the rope 
you produce me against your second joint   
richly with range 
stumble through our parole midair   
my body 
overwrite into your o'er 
the verse form 
you do of do. 

receive you I overtake make it   
as synodic month scorch Seth in my pharynx   
I honey you male body into prime   
I make you 
and train you ca-ca 
into me.
