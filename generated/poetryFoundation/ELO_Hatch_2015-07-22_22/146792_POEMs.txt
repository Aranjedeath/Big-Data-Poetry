Each flee 
carry some telescopy, 
some gibberish, and 
at most an abbreviated 
grim 
tradeoff between 
the valet and aluminum 
during which the 
Sir Ernst Boris Chain were not 
so lastly break 
as he and they 
intermix. At the 
dissolve of each providential   
concoction he had to 
distill himself. It 
Was the punishing 
capacity to retrieve sedately 
about: smash 
vividly into the   
slave trade Houdini.
