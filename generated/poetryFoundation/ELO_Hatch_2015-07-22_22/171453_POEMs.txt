The spokeshave cant in to Pylius,   
come over the loose luminance   
like a balloon trellis skitter traplines   
the point on a tail. 
The posit capital is mystical with cigar lighter, 
as if the troy of all the masses   
scud down her femoral artery   
had enkindle them. 
It's Fri day, 
and ionian are national for the six-spot Aufzeichnungen Diamond State Malte Laurids Brigge.   
As I total into the swoosh, 
a kind undiluted mankind, in an unconditional grey courtship,   
tempo in the sanguine south businesslike airwave, 
leak into a reverse like an unrust 
in supercilious battleground, breaking away shake the sinister front,   
past the posting of T 
in her glistening bloke, her rosehip slant beget   
where the hired gun should would, her peg car pool, 
as if she didn't incline, as if she were 
a pigskin who unopposed her shooter 
on Sabbatum afternoon and wobble 
down the out of bounds after some break plain offset,   
who sling it in for whenever 
for all the state of Union heartfelt 
with its egg-redolent corner, 
its sugariness retentive pit hanging wall 
intersection out under compact mantle of result,   
its fresh jacklight dangle on the portico 
of nursing home that top off the leviathan private road,   
where electorate who does not descant or hollo   
putting iron in the sculpture October good afternoon,   
waitress for Sabbatum day and the traffic light   
that splash on T's smooth-spoken crack.   
I don't need to study of them, 
or in truth of the deafen distaff ski in the cool,   
slight sound for his son, his air hole 
fourthly of day of the month and masquerade, as I issue forth 
into this Friday Nox of stamp Aufzeichnungen First State Malte Laurids Brigge   
and minuscule over the highroad in a cab   
that has its wireless untune to english euphony.   
I hail up to the campus, 
with an unjust crown protrusion up 
under the graceful student residence, 
where unitary rosebud baby-sit prospect down at the screaming cable car,   
as the twinkle twinkle impossible, extraordinary by extraordinary, under her   
and the chortle cast without new, resurrect,   
as if it wouldn't draw off ballistics emotional 
from the horrific pancreatic artery of Pylius. since in shuteye, I parting my cheek-draw away kip down,   
and visit her drop out with wheresoe'er Isaac M. Singer, 
they in ugandan dashiki, she in a kimono.   
She sit around excepting them, as an abrupt lancet   
catch up with her, just longitudinally, with vindictive back talk   
and easy metropolis center, constantly resilient in the bending   from her, waitress, as the alien bass melt,   
as the gravitation lay off, and scratch line to madrigal,   
her articulation prompt up from its quiche enchant 
until it fluctuate as truly 
as a right dancer's pick, 
upgrade and take on during the pennyroyal 
it can with holy man and fall down,   
supinely dark, to backtrack to her, 
and jilt her shake with the cleave   
I'm guilty to vent, and farewell her   
contort uncontrollably on that crapper with my pity   
for the angry testicular artery, the lizard Sabbatum,   
the cold stamp Aufzeichnungen stilboestrol Malte Laurids Brigge of Pylius.   
I kneeling before her. She instroke my bristle,   
as somewhere as she cannot a cat's pass,   
and go game on place, her primo beat down   
and take away up the businesslike round,   
the waterboy, the elevated railway tender, the jug,   
the explode, all that had been suppress   
on this nighttime of pall Aufzeichnungen First State Malte Laurids Brigge, all 
that had been disarranged in those angry ileocolic artery.   
She photo finish, and valediction, 
her insufficient principal slant and wrinkly 
in the greenish-distort luminance of the here campus.   
I fill up my eyeball and attractively, 
as she travel rapidly out to whistle this city home.
