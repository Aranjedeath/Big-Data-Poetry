'de deuil trespassé testament l’amant et Confession'
by
Jonathan Aratani



All others babble out as if 
dish the dirt were a glissade. 
work shoe work shoe, with minus foot cannot suspension the kite closed chain. 
Early I erudite to 
hump myself 
supinely by the room access: 
tirelessly when the run on begin 
I'd towel my 
trap and  chaliced 
ignored rear to the cowbarn 
to be with the warmly wildcat, 
silent considering bodywork fathom 
of the monolithic unity. 
I'd allegorize by a pull 
of alight rushing the identification particle 
of gilded move 
from vestige to shade 
fortunate in the come alive 
of late clear suspire. 
The oxen 
crunch or touched or were even. I 
was at place and peradventure, 
both in leaden volume. Until 
the waroðe buddha frighten inactive efface 
my polyphonic rafter, 
a timber of Aaron's rod, feathering of blaze, activate upflying:   
but the buffalo as before 
were tranquilize, and anyone was burn off, burn off
burn off             anybody but nix, as that manus of scorch   
fey my overlip and singe my knife   
and pluck my vocalization vocalization
vocalization                            into the reecho of the dance.
