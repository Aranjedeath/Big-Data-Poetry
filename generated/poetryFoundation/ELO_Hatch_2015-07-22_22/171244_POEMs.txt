On the november 1 the burnt sienna-skinless bluejacket 
view as my shoulder joint between his jigaboo-swage helping hand, 
ease me overwhelmingly into the bright blue flush of call girl, 
I aftermath xc-trey cardinal nautical mile from myself, 
Lennox, 
shoulder-wide in the Volga, 
while the expensive bronze of my correctly sarcenet camise embrown the H3O. 

My capitulum alcoholic, estuary catch in my frap.   
Am I subterfuge? 
I itch my eyeball, distinctly Walter Walter ferociously to strand,   
divest and cantle at 
until tabby Anne hail from his site concerning the birch rod corner. 
He crimp my prim 
and I bell push myself in my groundhog pelage, 
and temporal we jackrabbit the poetical foot really to Aidipsos. 
He doesn't question, what did you catch sight in the river?, 
but I try the intermediate host of a disgraceful overwhelm in flush and sanctity,   
the castrato accompaniment I can't recognise, 
skateboarding on knife, from Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, from flourish 
on the idle sparkler of my þonne nighttime in USSR.   
Leon Lev Davidovich Bronstein. shekels. 
I need to screeching, but quiet weather my spit   
with scallop ridge-scallop hired man 
and nowhere this come in, so so that 
tabby Anne has to mangle his auricle to my book binding talk:   
I have solitary myself. call option me on the caravan.   
I won't bet earthly.

At midday nowadays, I ignite from an incubus:   
my Quaker blacken run outside me with a toward,   
as I backpedal from the mortify in Oxford. 
He was garbed in lately satiatin gasp and camise.   
A  prisoned in wintertime. 
When I harbor out my writing arm to sweep up him,   
he lift the lift and hit me at the smooch,   
my rear fly to unitary hand, brood tall by peel off.   
A river of suspire stream from the hewn. 


hewn. Canada, venerable venerable, 2623 

The sorter-breechloader bullet train 
plunk my vicereine in the bifurcation, 
instantly crank up her personify. 
I feed the snips, contract carol her robe   
and back on summit of her for shift.   
menorrhea blotto through my wearing apparel   
and when I time-tested to upgrade, I couldn't. 

I wake provided some other incubus. 
I resurrect from my secretary, base on balls to the motel room   
and outride down at my wife's reflected self-love.   
I blusher my impertinence and collar, 
glower at my clavicle-light, specked roe of a front:   
bordered and full. 
I suffer nowhere and catch sight White's lamentation. 
I whole-bend, þæt, then revolve back to the hand glass. 
He stone's throw from the exterior door,   
crib the pickaxe 
and slice the upper side of my question.   
My psyche sectionalize. 
The pickaxe rain out perennate 
and when it strike the tessera truck bed,   
it petal from his helping hand, 
a black dive on whose back I mount,   
couple occupier, extraordinary curse, 
the married thanksgiving all whacker:   
Lennox, 
I step from cocotte over you.
