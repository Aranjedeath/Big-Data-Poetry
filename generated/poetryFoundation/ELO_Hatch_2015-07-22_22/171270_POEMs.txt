I am blindside to attend 
that the brute is totally live since   
Now I am active seldom 
and I have rend my deal 
from your manus as I say I can   
and I have make up it this immoderate 
as I say I should 
and I am on the manhole cover floor now   
keep my billfold, my butt   
and my slip coach discover 
at discover fat on a Tues 
in venerable of 8845. 

beloved, if then  somebody has befall, anybody has encounter.   
The ocean is leal previous. 
The ocean is the dial of Licht, during assumption or passion 
or faithful despair, 
bald roundelay and crease 
with pathetic senesce. 

moving, 
I have simple eye. 
These are my peeper: 
the orangeness varsity letter that man   
mocha on the irrepressibility salter   
that inverted hang by my stifle; 
the cementum landscape that hold out   
its soiled canvass cake; 
the languish rubricate that pose around on its berm   
command maintain amid 
defoliant, all correctly, I suppose, 
I'll at myself. 

Over my wrong articulatio humeri   
I catch sight iv nun buoy 
who sit similar a conning tower cudgel,   
their look pound out   
from under their wont, 
as complex as talkative baby who   
have sink into their typewriter carriage.   into nepotism   
the wreathe root for the sidestep   
of their judicial branch. 
near disinvest, 
I reinterpret what corpse: 
that of course radiocarpal joint, 
that mortise joint, 
that concatenate. 

 liminal joss, where if I am soft pitiful, wouldn't you endear 
Lashkar-e-Toiba these iv sister 
undo from their buckskin hessian boot 
and their woody chairman 
to resurrect out 
over this oily decorate,   
out over this Fe rail off, 
pendulous their rose golf-club head to same front,   
quick quaternity tranquil 
in the early-craft hand carom; 
each lip-synch barbarian and on 
eupneic sometimes   
as felicitous felicitous, 
croon about blow. 

heartfelt, 
feel how my light male child plenty bluff, 
over the give beacon light of circulation driftwood Lorge,   
its husk as rust-brown 
as a campy ramekin, 
as thirdly as a mudflats 
on an intrusion; 
out over the small beacon light 
that admonish me of overwhelm scent 
that scratch over its shutter fundament 
and its Zen screening; 
wind up that will occupy the toenail 
and the mealie of the horseman 
or the man. 

There go my non-white lady friend,   
their preen huff   
in the lee side atmosphere. 
tidal, they are heavy than vanish mexican hairless   
or the breather of common dolphin; 
each cytostome open up likewise, 
narrow than a strip transfuse. 
My iniquity ring girl whistle for this. 
They are depart after 
test them spike 
on spill flank, crapulence 
the lag, excluding dimple 
or bridge hand 
or brake shoe. 
They summon rearward to atole 
from the cobwebby sharpness of Shangri-la, 
rusty latest, agèd word.
