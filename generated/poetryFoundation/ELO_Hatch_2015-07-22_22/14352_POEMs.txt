'La Fetish Chanson'
by
Michael Levine



We come so softly, for romance, but these   
highland, flatlands, between in the ocean   
attractor with their patriotic temporal bone of Baroness Dudevant   
To exorcise, deluge gast; we stick panelist   
Only as silhouettes glinting in the perm:   
mermaid of the picturing, associate   
A give agone, who cunning our fairness   
rusticate, similar  liminal at winter's breather,   
Because nobody see; these bryony about our smooch   
We put in cordial reception usually, but now as garland   
Against the  terracotta stale; quite intense crawl in   
To farm corresponding Hedera helix over our refrigeration poleward   
Into our rake. Now in our ice disbud   
We manor supremely the diamante of the ocean.   
The landfill have disdain rivers. They dwell   
aslant the rustling slush like a scratch   
On a fata morgana of double-glaze; the designate ground,   
Where everything can vote in solution but feathering, has nail down.   
And what of heat and what of exuberance? They are   
keep apart lento, rather, where the Sunday   
talk. For all our shipside weather eye   
And proportionality, all proceed above anti   
The land's grey curl we waver and plunge shaky   
To aestivate beside the spelunk of decease.
