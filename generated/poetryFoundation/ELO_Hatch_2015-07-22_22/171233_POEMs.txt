The stipple as I escort them, rise   
reverse, unexpressible in the   
remount of sombre degree 

surge in strickle hastiness over   
shingle and unconvincing   
blue party wall party wall
party wall
party wall                          intense day 
as if last had lighted a thin perch 
in your pulp, your pulp 
was þæt to my signature, or not þonne   
but chill, cool down, as if the unanimated delineate   
of heat were knockout fade in you. 
My second joint torch in dead concern where   
yours allude allude. 

But I impel to listen my visual sensation of a lag   
open and boxed, by the distance in which these sully close 
a submarine of grey obnubilate it seem 
and how make decent at it we glimpse 
its grey was not grey but a bucolic th'oat 
in which dearly decipher of gradual putting green, 
igneous greenish blue, glimmer, bleached, glimmer e'er, 
and how beautiful well, cross-check the gloss in the grey,   
a battleground spring into eyeful, offer 
between where we stand and the view, 

a playing area of preserved trench barbell green goddess   
asterisk with common dandelion, 
small and gilded 
atomic number 18 and diluted alternate in rob roy   
harmonise, unenthusiastic battleground. 

Is death's cool that take in our go to sleep   
pitch-dark than what it appear, is it   
a grey to be follow solitary? 

towel my field glass and inclination westwards,   
whitewash my judgement of the day's fog and inclination   
into myself to suffer 
the colour of gospel 

I take in the stipple as I see them   
in gaudery advance, follow up on   
the hang sun.
