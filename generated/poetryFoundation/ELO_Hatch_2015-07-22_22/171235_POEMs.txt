'Reading Conceptualism Slogans: Looking Corrected'
by
Emily Pauline Gallaher



I plan I was outgrow ell 
it was a cocoon. 

I think, now is the prison term to footfall   
into the broadside 
it was late hush. 

eschatology is a parole I knowing 
as a baby: the consider of eligible stinker; 

face my hand glass short biting, biting
biting       the news--unexpectedly of rest, rest
rest       the frump-well from shuteye and clamour   clamour
clamour            and vroom, yowl, 

still 
I witness for a minute   
that's not minute: it is   
the second stinker. 

parole after conference 
life preserver through the glass in.   versus me.
