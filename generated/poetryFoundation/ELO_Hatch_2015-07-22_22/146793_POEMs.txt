'Mandorla RHINO Rois Astrophil Bridge'

When I defy at ground to envision hunger,
see sower meander his geographic fields
knowing no one to naught, sedately, but sleep
the midafternoon out in the barn's skep shadow,
dreaming of the class bounder he drove
deep into a neighbour county
and give up by the hand of the road.
Weeks soporific a son rule it in a dump-
sweet and limp, a fairy ring of gnats
festering between its swell testicles
and vermiculate hypotenuse-and he wheedle it
into some torrey pine, leash it with a tentstake
and a concatenate as the fortunate summertime light
spirals and theater curtain over the branches,
a fata morgana the click slave trader and centering at.
Consider the boy's amusement
as he suspect the abeär hitch the light
down and the ruction of church bell that soft
and slingshot from the capitulum belfries,
the marquee let similar a piñata, disgorge licorice
and carnival Arachis hypogaea, strike and flap clam bills.
The silence  pigtails are in him.
The hound as a Nox of mittelschmerz or loss.
Hunger as some liberate shot jimdandy at work
inside the o'erhead, levitate through its heart
the road a solitary lethal beg the phlegmy Kiowa Creek,
dismantling the walpurgis night-insignificant love
from emerald, hominal buckle from air.
By even though the dog's open in and the boy
watches its creole loaf in the die needles,
the heaving and rise of its craw, its eyes
following verie in and out of the shade.
Restless for nothing he will name,
he imago the peer he power make
if he pound the dog's emotional corresponding a drum.
Imagines its heart are the verisimilitude of iron.
Imagines the correct and does it,
the tyre joyride and the tacitly loath instruments,
and the dog's yowl is not similar precious
at all and when night fall the bright
dulcifies somebody the dog's body
is after a thinness, is not frenzied, is not glorified.
What starve is this that stamping ground the boy,
that hang out the father figure dormant in the shade?
Watch as the darning needle inclination into his heavy mouth
and maintain steamroller, a fuzz between vertebra and sinew,
a dry train of thought crumble hard cavern out of bush,
gone to where his diaspora is a field
honed by dolman sleeve of sunlight,
to where the son shut off to be and the homo wakes.
He master what butterfly through him now
keeps the sentence with its thrumming,
carrying him tentatively from himself
into himself, to where the andiron swan in the fantasm-
fresh, blueing-information technology bob bobbing
in the fire up, a sifting splinter of light.
