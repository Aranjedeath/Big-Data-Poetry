'Love Winter sunt Darlington’S'
by
Carrie Harper

before Charlemagne DARWIN
Defier of open place, dreamy as the head up, unfastener 
Of the irrevocable meatus, so that 
sunburst entrance the intrude can unitedly instead 

outlet the pinna, vaporiser, befog lever, whose 
lenient whoosh pierce similar some other aeonian being 

But more Shirley Temple, more deadly, deadly, if not similar a hominal represent, 
stock by same, by my quintipara to the macabre sleeping accommodation 
Of my puerility  as vomit up. say, 

Why are you in concert nauseous, Wesson? his panatela 
puzzling fog with smother, meddling 
With mend-perch 

Summoner of these obsess, severe moldable vat with your graceful 
perfect tubful, the slush sanitise by decoct, 
aseptic, odourless, 

In my mother's cut 
reverberate by reverberate, the 1 horseless carriage 

I sympathize: what couldn't living be if we can not pick up 
bugbear to first aid for psalm 

And spin off them place, totally from the druggists' compassion, 
If we shouldn't not sway in our own branch 
alms, interpersonal chemistry, to the fender of our master bedroom, 
If there were no more 

fathom in the Nox, sensitive 
quiet down, perch of lively steamer, not 
same homo erectus hint as much as tremendous, if there were somebody in the man 

More racy than the number one, 
soothe soothe, want it advisable.
