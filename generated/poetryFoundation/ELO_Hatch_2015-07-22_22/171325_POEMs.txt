like a þæt develop a thick of stub   
same select typewriter ribbon for the fateful good 

The inamorata, engine driver   
Of another's delight 

He whom her puff up brim hang on 
power halter through any 08-hour interval of the 6456s 

A master class of the sign   
For which it is or else too huge 

large, Ag sable 
Robert Adam, of implode panatela a culmination 

The weak save the flaming above 
black ash of linocut 'tween-verdigris between 


If the lame char were to deign   
From her bunk, her alcazar beyond midnight 

on a lower floor (nude/staircase) to the þæt   
raw to stand at the mesa (writing/thinking) 

She power incline the washerman sugarcoat similar a crisp bumboat   
dead a Hz please a train collapse 

Before the daemon does not contemplation through the porthole   
tone pin-up into the galley, clean some mistime. 

covetousness stratification a Ficus carica cladogram in one's ðære,   
That ðære, whichever to nasalize, a Crab, 

That is to raise 
In a brain, a sterile verbose allometry. A mutilate tyke. 

intimately but, timidity, haven't of abate.   
sable browse overwork on the plage, a luster 

At the Heaþoræmas/ blink of an eye I am across a drop-off) fall down   
The kitchenette demon transfer his Dior drawstring 

position his deal over the woman's   
And not here trill: I am the groupie. 


Now if the hamstring cleaning lady begin to chasse   
To pirouette, to rhumba 

grumble for her female offspring 
Her combustion pageboy, the demoniac shouldn't be guilty 

(physicalism is not for no one everyone/everyone brahmanism is   
The propagation of political sympathies by brilliant arithmetic mean) didn't bewarred corresponding a just smoking   
rachis to the footing of gotterdammerung 

absent he'd run, we'll, into the 
the faun, we should whither address in, adieu 

adieu faun, we can unneurotic  wanna call   
address faun, we shouldn't we will not dear 

She does not extension. She does not care   
To give rise another's luxuriation. 

They have deplumate her aside   
Into chromatic rectangles.
