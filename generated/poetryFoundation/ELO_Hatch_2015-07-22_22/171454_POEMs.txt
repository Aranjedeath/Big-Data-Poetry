In a dawning coat,

hands mesh near your enough,

you parade accrete over the orphan in your head.

These others tripod with you, 

squinched the urban center into home away from home, 

until now should watch what you glimpse, 

what you can see

 visual sensation of these walk, 

lay out same a star,

or care a body,

the sow vibrate of itself, 

bust into the mære,

dancing up to block up at the oddment of the universe.

I give your imaginativeness suffocate as long as this, 

the nut of the world,

where everything keep exterior, and moves,

holding what is most against it against itself,

moving, as after it experience its close, against death.

In that order,

the diminished animation, the king case assume shape.

Yes, sometimes cautiously at this north northeast, 

love's concert eat you,

the auspicate homo habilis, poove, the daughter of God.

I raise you into this time,

sagaciously to that spot

and dictate these adumbration 

into your mind,

and make out it wouldn't not be light to you 

to stand up in the domain and vanity 

of a metropolis not your acuity airily.

Now, I have prospect the texts

and like of metropolis that burned,

that rotten, or give their baby tardily, 

have been peck at my skin,

watching my herder move,

feeling the slant and birdie of my trunk, 

hear out with a capitulum as shoot as God's 

to get some hæle richness in my lung-power. supposing I am truly in your city,

trying to gauge that not here the tremor starts.

There moldiness be some mistake.


Over the cape, 

in a fluorine stations,

you and I trip to the time

of some other pageant. 

These citizenry, changed,

but sufficiency ours,

shake some other gotterdammerung 

from that egg.

Some will command you

that genesis are instead

local restlessly,

that anyways the clamour of these drums

could land our Supreme Being to earth.

A metropolis, like a life,

must be make in purity.


So they address you,

knowing you are electrical with stars,

to smelt this foggy bottom capital, this body.

So they address in you,

knowing you essential scour the ground.


“Sir, be well me to remember to your idea that meter, in which the armament and net of the illustrious treetop were exercise, with all tacit cause in scaling to blow up you to a state of villeinage: tend promised land, I bid you, on the revue of hazard to which you were uncover; introspect on that clock, in which all neandertal tile grant fulminate lip, and in which canto despair and backbone wear the expression of inaptitude to the clash, and you will not but be chair to a burying and unlettered feel of your suitable and scented embalmment; you can but appreciate, that the argue enfranchisement and repose which you get off you have mayhap meet, and that it is the particular sign of Heaven.”




“Reflect on that time.”

The purport bm, suddenly

in the outgrowth of men,

hidden in a language

that will not pelt it.

You were invariably lost

in the linguistic process of quotient alone;

you were make lost

to the taproot vibrate alone,

holding all dialectic but it.

“Look advance, I beseech you,”

over your own pulp escapes.


The nut now librate into a city,

and a father-figure now tap where you walked.

Wind and pelting moldiness rustling him,

and a man essential wattle against them.

We recognize unless to a fault, that accelerator pedal stations

must reshoot the mannequin of a man

-warmheartedness at his psyche, intermezzo at his feet,

his beggary and his stupa at his hands.

Image of cote mental picture of man

pulled tail into himself

into the scatter before the movement,

into the secrecy before the sound

of bm, into stillness,

which Crataegus laevigata be anima-regard,

or further stillness.


Recall number.

Recall your calculations,

your ken, at night,

into the confidence of stars.

But dead you essential exorcize this ground.


“Here was a wee, in which your gig grope for for yourselves had in use you in concert to promulgate, you were patiently boldface with unspecific mind of the mammoth misdemeanor of shore leave, and the available self-command of those boon, to which you were knight by animality; following Sir, how dingy it is to mirror, that til you were so distraught confident of the beneficence of the engender of human beings, and of his ombihtþegne and euphonious diaspora of these left and marital communications privilege, which he adobe consult to them, that you should at the perfect space age undermine his quarter, in stall by defalcation and fury so indocile a craton of my comrade, under moan enslavement, and fell yoke, that you should at the old clip be rake up shamefaced of that most inglorious work, which you tenderly hated in others, with regard to yourselves.”




Can we suppose now

that it is the god

who anchor chain excell to this perch? 

Is it this god

who need the intermezzo, 

the cut of movement,

the foreshadowing of intermezzo 

or else under his catch? 

If so,

what melancholic is the categorize 

for these dancers,

these invocations,

the view of these greater earth-god 

line out the land?

How shake it is to mirror below that Supreme Being, since blessing, than the feel of that hear

beginning of movement, 

where incessantly the god

becomes some other and not himself,

himself and not some other. 

So they moldiness yelling up you,

knowing you are faulty with stars;

so they essential call you,

knowing carnival settlement. 

You override in meditation, 

actuate from stream to line,

struggling for a city

skinny of that strain act,

mortal of someone but the evangelical,

magic number, which itself suffocate free.

Free. liberate. How will the agate line capitulation 

into that configuration?

How will you clear this restlessness, 

placard your number crunching and forecasts

into a world you yourself shouldn't enter?

Uneasy, at night,

you postdate starlet and power line to their limits,

yellow of yourself, o'er of the consonance 

of none and so right you moan

for the lose dissonance, the break through in the universe.

Your duplicate, I rifle it out, 

and call you back;

your duplicate, I invoke

the stemma of Queen.


I suppose your dream pass as far as this. 

And so you, you electric sander, 

take the air in vain onto these side, 

the city an asterisk, a body,

the milt tickle off you, 

and vibrate almost,

beyond your power,

beyond mine.
