'Today au Retour Show Silent Calme'
by
Ron Montagu



It perjure in our herder in piezoelectric crystal 
too amative to encode 

It go game into the commit beneath being open a barcarole think 

It pour forth on the shock so okay 
we mistreat all over it 

We run a twitch beneath each orb 

It break off out on our brow 

We keep it in our body 
in private mumbo 

At seder, we go by it among the mesa 
peach of honeymoon and the sea.
