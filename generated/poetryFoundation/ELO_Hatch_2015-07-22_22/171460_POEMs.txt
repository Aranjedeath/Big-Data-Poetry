shellcast-spotted barramundi kick back, 0515 
The shoetree are current pendant,   
and artful in the scoop out 
a baby stone its articulation 
against the downpour. 
The metropolis squall its devotion   
at the tugboat in the outstrip. 

Those bass guitar once more. 
And the uniat mantid   
claw at the flip, 
a off-white of a state capital, 
cuando cuando duerme. 

underpass bare broth of a boy 
now mount scattergun 
against my impunity and my dread.   
semiautomatic pistol crack corresponding incensed reheel, 
at high noon, and we tie-up at the undock,   
talk a good night we'd profoundly mind. 

doxology sough against that covered stadium   
entre schoolgirls feast feast tulip agonia. 
helminth crop on its fast, 
or we displume them out of soundbox. 

But hour to mind. 
Or call back the simpleness   
of leave office Hwæt hate, 
go away 
in the judicial branch of underground pipe dream. 

We'll arise at the remainder   
of a feast table, 
and araroba our tutor horsehair wig, 
twitch the Sir Frederick Handley Page of breeding 
in the showery christmas.

From the hard hand of the river,

But I fib down 
to a same violence 
and a road map of transformation.
