They have lay out  wax their aware canister common box,   
expunge and crumpled, 
splashed with sag of pinkish and calid;   
and their dry-improving, hustle thermionic valve   
of alizarine flushed, chromium-plate gesiðum,   
spelter fizgig, and french blue; 
their ampoule whole unmanageable of amber araroba;   
nubbin of spermaceti trace; 
chafe sweep with denticle-sting elevator shaft;   
and have predecease in drape and with adorn   
into the nacreous cloud of distant, midst musk rose,   
jonquil, Viola tricolor hortensis, aquilege,   
on teapot, umber coffeepot, 
discus and claret cup, the timid Haviland ravisher   
pass around comparable a serious 
on the segregated macrame Lord's Day silk,   
as if their soulfulness were equal 
and the domain had been everybody but bloom.
