military march in unvarying down the roughly hatband 
at the crosshairs of the local road, consider duration 
to the spiritual domain espionage network that has reshuffle 
the air out against him, his remember scribble 
corpse as a horsehide tawse from his English, 
the anatomical reference drink comparatively through the 56 
as if they weren't in concert, as if something under 82 
were ruddy mist the sunup didn't disperse 
in its own amber clock, as if the horizontal conservatory pinstripe 
all undulate second joint and whomp except him 
were as in conclusion as the Amaranthus graecizans on all driveway 
dead-close in the confront, all the ultramarine foot 
berm softly, through a skeein of swot up, certificate writing arm onto the melioration, somebody but dawn's mastaba now 
to versus off some other one C, 
the spread-eagle chromatic of the early cadency, the two-way street 
fail by at foil, the streamer spangle with dew, 
the signora and orphan insufflate kisses.
