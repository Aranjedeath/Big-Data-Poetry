'Tale Woods Tears Amyntas'
by
Robert Mazur



No more wolf nontextual matter: filet: a dextrous blackjack behind the alongalong
along       backbone

from shadow winnow to the bolshy ceras: crusade detective story with a detective storydetective story
detective story       set blade

through the quick finger cymbals: Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and chromatic scale on present and presentpresent
present       longhand:: the Hellenic God,

as like an expert, rule significant swooning, but in annoyance and
      frustration:-

Heaven cry, your euphony, are all about you: wrinkly wrinklywrinkly
wrinkly       but hungry: sociality is dark::

the audacious angle five-spot the archaeornis slide for the interior in no
      lovely spirals.
