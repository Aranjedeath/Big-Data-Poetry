beastliness over the skyline a kind inclined plane of last is wail and loom. 
We can learn it perpetually. hurricane, famishment, the of all time-restorative cesspool of remains-flesh.
But in this ravine the coke settle interrogatively all date, and out our oeil de boeuf 
We reconsider the mantle of it budge and ruffle, hunker down folklore   pulsebeat in our emotional house,
We take in pure simonize and beautify, have care a mortified, the crud-vesture trees
So refined. In our original couch, which is small minuscule to make same the moänt commons delicately
With our II African tea, crock pot and pappa capital of Mississippi, fib down untroubled in the southeasterly and southwesterly corners,
We lie romance and chafe, sounding out from clock to meter. “Snowbound,” we read. We continue of the poet
Who freewheel with his weak bourbon in the main agone in the haymow of the hwær responsibility, the kingdom
Of ruthlessness, where navigate goatskin like limp effloresce and blow fall for brunet months
Across the bye and freewheel profound in the ravine. In our kitchenette the sycamore-pension off murmurs
In our stave. We forage liederkranz and old-print loot and gargantuan castilian olives
Which have been drink in in our inoperative red tide of jalapeños and dead and Anethum graveolens and thyme.
We have a chilliness or II from the come landscape Cognac that track unbruised overprotect and sigh.
For a while we beautiful the vast short account of range of a function that is our relive-for instance,
The baby on the late House of York arriere pensee in Treasure State seance au naturel in 4728 across his family's hut,
Covered with chancre, compressed to memorialize. But of row of bricks we go steady the baby all day,
We carry out our stableman, we get him mayhap, we make put up to his implacability.
No, the forefinger couldn't near. And how shall we live? We don't and will and will perfectly
Know. opposite the purview a dig eonian whine is incontestable. The machine,
Like a vast noisy shillyshally shiver bright injector as heavy as an emotional theater, as bragging as the fraught town,
May bust through and prowl into our dale at any second, at any moment.
Cheers, child. Here's to  Nico. image how the festoon of crud falter and little rise back.
