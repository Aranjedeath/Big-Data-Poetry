For my blood brother, â€˜neath, who barrack me to get a fitting for the baptism of Confession
Concerning your z in which you require

your own decussate, 
your andiron-burn crown of irritant, 
no big than a pollex, 
fag end and hushed, no thorns, this rise 

I crave to its shade off, 
that grey mecca 
where it lie awake on your sadhe sadhe.sadhe.sadhe.sadhe thick, low. 
I abhor my fall and I control to understand

for the avid, 
they are the tongue's brawl, 
the world's potage, the rat's star.
