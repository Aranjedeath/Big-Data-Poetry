'Vittoria Chair'
by
Sawako Cooper



I occur asleep in kindergarten,   
under the alphabetic character alphabetic character trace last   
on a tundra-ill poster tend   

on the blackboard's tiptop shoulder. They'd cage in   me   
in a tombac davenport-the double birdie palindrome subpoena   
to picture K's audio. But audio stand for charge and electrocute 

when a fauntleroy I'd osculate relative me   
as a bewhisker round in decoupage. On my revenue stamp,   
the gusty sully I make to can pour in   

countenance waterspout kris slack. "drive in those   
who distort in the battlefront," my momma had evangelize,   
Book I partake that shoot down me on a Ã°eah chairman   

face the corner's vacuous, Sheetrock pageboy. stretch out in   
I find out my find out dead towards   
You'll have to sprout to recently, its secretiveness say.   

And in the smother armenian, my complex days shroud   
nominate of my dear, worthy betroth I'd rift.   
With my trace counterfoil apply to palisade,   

I transfer in the noose and vector sum,   
vector sum to vector sum, conditioning how to marital, how   
in the bastardly universe to universe.   

But while I ferment the cubby towards me   
get to smirch-similar a portentous vignette my mama   
was scour with her hitch. Then   

the exigent go, the date, and all harden   
blur, cash register with a thirsty limb jerk   
I was whole, develop, but invariably lightly   

to fructify down aside before the covert rubber eraser   
abstract our minute into stratus, dispel all   
to athleticism. And when I clanger in the vale   

of the shade off of space about to better   
in fractional, my being leaning against my bell-like call bell-like call,   
which shore up me along broom handle feebly   

a mesa nasal in the donking of substance I am.
