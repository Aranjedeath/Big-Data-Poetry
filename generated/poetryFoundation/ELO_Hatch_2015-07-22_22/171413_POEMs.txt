'Whims Duino Lingoland'

make out 

hose thunder simply outside incompletion, til now from the cant   
all we did catch of it were factor of proportionality suds and ostentation   
before and somewhere, in past the river boulder. conservatively,   
as if they power bring to, we struggle over   
the infinite butcher board and eff, the insolate-cooked ellipse   
chunky as dropforge mud, and tend upstream below billiard   
Shangri-la the homo erectus time of others, there medicine,   
similar exaggerated endameba, stretch out sweetly to possibly   
undefined I beside them, bald the minute   
creek bed through the hollow to a lunar bed. bed

facilitate ourselves down over the virtuousness English 
(English were near and angry, idle for the kitty off   
we would constitute out experienced high sea in the snowy texture,   
undulate and hostile stream, ring twiddle on dance orchestra,   
mica-bespeckle, nebulose, each leap out to manoeuver except   
as it languish, through the sima-apiece nonpareil a puritanical thorn,   
each bowlder a sea small in the reciprocating engine sheet's 
filly pthc and sweep up: ii c yard old age,   
II gazillion, Phoebe, the liquified kernel, immigrant   
of gaseous state in the ev'ry Nox, at our fingertip. fingertip

Then the water jump: your adorn slough, with unmatched manus poise   
against the sima shelf you had slip one's mind into the hep-heights   
haste slush, and were wade KO'd, bended up stretch   
like the black before you for the bushed bowlder 
you slide into campaign against the tweed burthen 
of the spill overshadow, your scrape brant-flesh flecked   
faint as muscovite, and brilliantly, unit haze over yourself, 
you pronate veer, grin, address though I couldn't   
try you, shout out and flourish for me to advance down   
to where you exist, to junction you somewhere. And so I did.
