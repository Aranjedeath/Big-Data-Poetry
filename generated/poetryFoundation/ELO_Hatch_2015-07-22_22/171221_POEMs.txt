I wishing it too goethite, I shortness to togs it   
until nothing snivel it off snivel. 
I neediness it bootless and backed, 
this trim, so no matchless has to truncate 
what's for I need to parade down 
the rue lively Cargill's and the memory stock   
with all those samara shine in the foreground,

sinker in their café, under the Melissa crony   
catapult pig it from the van and below the normally,   
lift the silken honker over their articulatio humeri.   
I need to march prefer I'm the gratifying 
char on ground and I can have my plectrum.   
I wish that crimson poultice badly. 
I need it to uphold 
your unsound reverence about reverence, 
to record you how steadily I aid about you   
or everybody behind what

from its strap wish I'm choose a personify   
to take me into this globe, through
