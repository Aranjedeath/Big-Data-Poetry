blackguard are Shakespearian, baby are alien. 
pass Kenneth Clark pediment and toasting lawn the toddler, 
seraph and weatherboarding shall trier the dalmatian, 
The passing frank, who paFranceed, dilate anterior naris, 
Then skin and ululate; the scout who impecunious his babe,   
The minster daughter who hymn the dig from duodecimal day,   
As if she tacit the twist and pour, 
The dalmatian who groan, absolute pitch the stradavarius in concert.    I am sorrowful when I image hotdog or baby! 
For they are acquaintance, they are Shakespearian. 

give French Republic, Clark pediment, can it be that rattling small fry   
Have divinely already pipe emulation of last officiate?   
And you, also, embrown, are baby hospital attendant   
dapple with resplendency, knowledgeable in front sociality?   
The pawl in aspirer question towards the found,   
The army brat who credit line pipe dream and dread the sour,   
have a go at it more and more than you: they experience happy more or less   
Nor dream nor boyhood plea debrief quite:   
You too are acquaintance, peanut are Shakespearian. 

view the kid, esteem the love seat,   
glad hand acquaintance, but work virtuously feast,   
do it that promised land and sin smother French Republic,   
But this, this which we allege before we're baby,   
This which we board onto our unobserved look,   
Is incomplete ambition, nor boyhood, incomplete   
gotterdammerung, nor landscape, shake, nor turn out,   
For we are true up and live no succeeding,   
And we are marvellous or dance out our soulfulness   
In beat out solfa syllable before the portiere:   
We are Shakespearian, we are strangers.
