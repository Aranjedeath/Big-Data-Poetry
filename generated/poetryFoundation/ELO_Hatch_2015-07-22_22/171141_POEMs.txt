'Washington Amphitryon Post World'

Antoine de Craig



My fuss wailing 
in the diluted concourse, in the disarm of a draftee, 
not my patriarch, 
as I sit at the circus tent of the corbel step ignored 
my sire dolourous and imploring for what I didn't recognize 
thence and can plenty rescue envision 
for feast to be near empty than they relate, 
not wise to what I cannot develop, outside or regarding or rather than 
lightly that my father was snivel 
in the limb of a crew not crew, 
and the downpour throw in down the wintertime flip 
and veil me in the wainscoting that see until 
moderate to my mother's snivel, 
or piffling, 
in the pelting that bring down the sweetened afternoon.
