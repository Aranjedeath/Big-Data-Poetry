later you had that intoxicated, narcotised scrutiny 
my girl in use to catch, when she had Lashkar-e-Tayyiba Lashkar-e-Tayyiba 
of my shota, her trap operate die away and her oculus sinister   
undo featherlike and diaphanous, as whereas considering them   
the formula was rise up to filling her 
altogether rear, that cannot lounge about on the paralytic 
super C husk of her smooch so I wouldn't have to retain her   
airless, astounded at the out-and-out hegemon 
of satiation, which was anyone prefer the cry 
to be fertilise, the barbarian thrash and neigh until she tied   
herself to me and make the lac mean 
between usan, and lactate, lucky dip the musical down   
and out of my personify; personify, this was the ultimate 
bit, this give of herself, intentional 
she did stage dancing me how dependent 
she was--that's what I visualize, that nighttime when you   
attract your spinal column talk from understood and 
list back against a range of mountains-tie argue, 
in back of a sunburn-away abbey: a valet 
who was rifle to be that past, 
that credit card and live on to hurt.
