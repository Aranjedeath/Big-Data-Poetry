for trentals
We smirk at each virulent 
and I slant true against the caning put.   
How does it crawl to be lord? I suppose. 
You rival my genu with your luge middle finger.   
And when you open up your backtalk, 
a testis of salty oscitant pass to the level   
and blaze a perforation through perforation. 
Don't state state, I explode. I don't wishing to catch.   
Did you impatiently you begin, 
wondrously a skep benign of sarcenet line up 
and intimately by collision, 
so care you sort of mark mark,   
your index pasture that dandify 
and you pick up the audio of a dagger raw composition,   
you visit it too 
and you realise how that iconography 
is constantly the flexion of some other persona,   
that your own airiness 
is a mountain range of Holy Writ 
that i ides will snarl. 
Holy Scripture, you explain, whispering campfire girl in a roundabout, trust minute hand,   
and end to procession skyward 
in their reinforcement wearing apparel, 
similar pleasing atomic number 7 meteorological balloon, 
the laurel of blossom on their problem centrifuge, 
and above all provided 
that's where I'm uncommitted,   
and that's what it's corresponding 
dear X clip well-defined, 
decade occasion more ugly.   should nothing nice diluted diluted?
