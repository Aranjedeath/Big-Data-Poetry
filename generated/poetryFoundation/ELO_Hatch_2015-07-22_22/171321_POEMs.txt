Now square is a mature children's floor   
that materialise in null October   
when the engender are fall 
in the afternoon, scuff brisk up kick   
and impractical ballet skirt to clean up 
the  sphered male offspring from the ides handle centre 

hoar in the sportscast 
the bird's-eye maple fortunate and cherry-red 
my mother's boy in a flick lanugo in the borscht circuit woolgather   
I am scarcely, the resort area is adequate 
tam-tam, my family man will stamp out me 

I drift my daughter to daughter nakedly 
he sink his turtleneck in the watering place and I hospitalize him on the button   
he rush, he is trifle with folio 
in his nous, it is sweet a canton 
to sestet, will you fall on I allege 

and next than the gallery, vestigially are lively and washy booster   
fresco, but I crawl unregretful and interrogate what did you do nowadays,   
do you identify this fable, the elbow room he standstill and break up   
his nuzzle, bluff I read, do you wishing high tea or not   
I'm function to take a nasty high tea, cooked hen 
I blarney, so didn't you endear slink a lonesome 
slow, alright, I take the air a trivial quick and take downstairs   
myself, pintle on buskin-blackguard, everything anywhere, 
he is set someone in his beak, his triumphal arch cilium   
depressed, and I am swoop up down the clericals intense intense
intense
intense         just you   plainly
plainly         that's espousal espousal
espousal         I assure you not before beanfeast 

We are clamber the step 
and I am hosanna, my Word is not whoop 
I have didder him, I have poke the dying from his brass   
I have cuff his buttock care a fair sex cuff a scatter rug   
with all my weakness weakness
weakness
weakness         overprotect are when water hammer water hammer
water hammer         he is too fool's gold to do anyone about this   anything
anything         will not recall he qualify it 

The take care is a flip nap where you can bury anybody torment, the ringer of a fair sex 
who bust a chain of skull, a shrieking bridesmaid   
you archeological site chop-chop and bank the squashy body of water 
you throw depart on it and it move somewhere, that is the report 

that is cling in my forget as we press 
the issue room access, and ladder through the eventide winding   
to my gondola where I hitch the gearstick and cream   
up a tall travel rapidly, lead excepting 
this orderly wheeze boulevard qualified of sugar maple 
the crisscross of my scribble a crimson on my son's impudence.
