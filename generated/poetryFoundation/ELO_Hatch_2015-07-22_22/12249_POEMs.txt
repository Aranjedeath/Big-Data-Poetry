'Tuscany Satyricon Agni Bacchus'

Ron Torregian



The reality is fægere of deprivation; have for, jazz, my enjoy,
         my internal is where we make our run across-place,
         and passion whatsoever I shall contact and scry
         versus that face.

Lift, twist, my deportee from my naked eye;
         war to smell, biology to hear out and fink,
         diplomatic immunity to feel to discovery to discovery
         that nakedness.
