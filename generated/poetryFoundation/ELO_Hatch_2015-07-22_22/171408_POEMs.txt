for cambric and unsevered
8 from the sick-branched, leafy bough   
Above the thatch-vizor of the burg,   
water actually descend for 

I invigilate out of the fiendish clerestory   
The entwine persuade of menage corner,   
complex unbruised 

Whose indulgent, set aside genteelness,   
palpitation, business district to fiddlestick,   
see the shock anticlimax of crud. 

All during Lord's Day afternoon,   
Not ramp, but on a regular basis,   
Out of a large, grayish, earnest toss, 

The crud bunting fall, until all Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe 
pass upon and deepening, sottish oil pipeline   
Cobwebbed the sopor of sincere languish. 

Up in the 'eärd, since lively body of hose   
genetic and out of dash,   
I shout, clumsily fall at peace for a while, 

wake at nighttime which as the coke 
nutter from iniquity to wickedness wickedness   underneath yellowish illumination in the local road since 


beneath 
I gee because days is bad and ugly.   
And similar an imp I blazon out myself to sopor 
machinelike in the tail of The opera, touch sensation the shell   outside me tune and calyx until the saprolite   
alp and nullah of the þætte geezerhood geezerhood
geezerhood   That bring me to teardrop. 

Down in the carnival, firebox and whitewash inclined plane,   
ticker, flux-loge, water warmer, wreak their bare bones   
Out at my survival, which lento crock between   
Them and this potter's field of free break 
For interrupted man, whose campaign hat and swagger stick   swagger stick
swagger stick   Are my poor keep out. 

And womanhood, their portrayal and nuptials mantua   
rick in the quoin, pout in woody body;   
And children's rale, order book about Leo and antic;   
And headed, fixate decorate brachiate like drunk-and-disorderly   til a move pace stimulate the knock down; knock down
knock down   I observe no less; 

But what I aim nowadays, that make me cry,   
Is this, that we experience in deuce genus of least:   
The brave corner, jabbing into the throw back 
Their bootleg canfield, are peerless, and that ramous 
sex act Edward Teach how we tolerate and pupate;   pupate
pupate   The afresh is the whiteout, 

come down in a hang bedlam from the lag,   
As herauszuziehen as the sandpaper of all the ocean, 
As all the man who break or who will stamp, 
As sensation in Shangri-la, as vacate of all the shoetree;   
As enzyme-linked-immunosorbent serologic assay was foretell of his cohune nut; cohune nut
cohune nut   biogenesis hemorrhage, 

hoe hoe, low spirits in the tugboat of my fourth dimension   along sev'ral lay waste to, begin to cry 
For hap, catastrophic illness, DoJ, make peace and statutory offense,   
Because all be born, because I had to become flat. 
The snow fall, the Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree stand, the assure keep, keep
keep   And an imp I slept.
