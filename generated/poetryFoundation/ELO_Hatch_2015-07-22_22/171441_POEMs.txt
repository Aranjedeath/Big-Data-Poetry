'Times panni purpurei Continuing'
by
Victoria Gl√ºck



Plato, antediluvian! 
We result by median 
How show-stopper carry 
empirical descriptor, 

How ergodic unfermented 
Will ordinary in an elaborate way 
If day be grateful 
And mistake cold-shoulder, 

But in our mettle 
exaggeration 
curve ball and come 
To alpha and omega. 

ballup is limitless. 
Nor go for nor indecision, unless both be idle, 
Will intermediate out.
