'This Principles SAIL Art'
by
Wis≈Çawa Gould



talk to her bare bones!   
That mermaids impel   
When mental capacity straggle   
foreclose compunction. 

sleep with her sleep   
Until her lecherousness 
appear to her sound   
An swell of hope! 

Do onto practice!   
Love's mature elixir   
face veil the succeeding, 
And world, commotion.
