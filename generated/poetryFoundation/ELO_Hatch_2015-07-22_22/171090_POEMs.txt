'Maria Book Battle York Nefeli'

Ricardo Chapman



leave-taking to the tidal in rye, 
So urgently to the sunburst in lager. 
The port make me raspberry and unoccupied 
But worry the crew in the pier glass. 
Goodnight to the moonshine in cognac, 
good day to the warmness of the dubonnet. 
I philosophize I can sometimes stall me under a glaze or a beer mug. 
Bye-pass to the chrism in the vodka, 
Ta to the amore in geneva. 
I'm stress to do what I regathered since 
admit that Hydra music. 
I won't want the forgetfulness and vomitus, 
The injury and fear. 
If I can stay put off the rotgut, 
There power be an exceedance for me nonetheless. 
So so hot to golden calf in a demijohn, 
To the nestle of singular and sweet vermouth. 
rent me slack my crave with slush 
And the E'en, guileless truth.
