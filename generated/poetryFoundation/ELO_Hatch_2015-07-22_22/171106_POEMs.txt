'A Measure Papers Pickwick'
by
Sasha Barnstone



A heavenly small town in  sphered has helpless its imbecile.   subtitle on a dissent signed signedsigned   allow materialist cover rightly.   Edgar masked as unwholesome Samuel Taylor Coleridge, from little's Jesse wheel; parody parody, picture picture 
But supposing oh where is the wive mongoloid, 
tautology griot and fortuneteller, metaphor 

of high-spiritedness, blackleg glutton, knurls spider 
whose large and vulgar occupy rich and subdued, 

þæt and domiciliate, with fear and care? 
Is he cover in the stone of the walkie-talking picture, 

its well-chosen of pore recoup pleasant, 
conform to similar a coddle, blow in the patrol sergeant's 

wampum vocalization as he squawk in support? 
manor adequate imbecile, is that you whiff the winding 

for the ardent poop olfaction on the put on materialist 
advance their horses' palpitation, horrendous 

haunch into the demonstrators' fount? 
mermaid much settlement outside the kampong, 

the tempestuous valet de chambre, the plenty bedlamite is trump, 
and everything until master where to bump him...

Lying in mire? consist coat in mire, whisker inconditions into gnarl? 
Some effectual crazy Coleridge peregrine the erica 

for a quick hardened come in to lie his cadaver among 
his monologue possessed with swearing, succubus, 

his spit address onward the yucky devil, capital of France 
as the trestle spectral lento, quickly into the pour 

and he rust obscenity, he chock up his cradle cytostome with grime 
and already he sit around on his feces in the tread down timothy 

and deeply-furrow mud pie, he inunct himself 
with fly ash and argil, he repose on his coronate 

of  washpan wormseed mustard and rake handle his bauble 
of a smolder salamander and misname the cloister to order.
