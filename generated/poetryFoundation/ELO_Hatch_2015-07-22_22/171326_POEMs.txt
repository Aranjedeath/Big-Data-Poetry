In a birdless of furrowed tin glass ceiling) 
And what was ever nonarbitrary ugly, the exuberant

Of gunfight, of torment I in cellarage,

Into right emerald home ground, or germ   
That commute a thickly bird's large intestine   
To be shit abroad.

And all rocker organic structure cold

Is a biology lab: invariably this lip rouge, these flush,   
These blue jean, these pendant earring, spiritual if I twitch   
My bristle and judder my pelvic girdle 

Exactly donking to the band's wildfire howl   
That take after history's cataclysm   
zap for atom-bomb, middling I'll outlive, 

perchance we'll all perennate. perennate.perennate perennate.perennate perennate.perennate 

At the metacenter of privation and pest 
The planet's kid-braw, hot, mermaids   
Out of their calabash-spin the profane ball.
