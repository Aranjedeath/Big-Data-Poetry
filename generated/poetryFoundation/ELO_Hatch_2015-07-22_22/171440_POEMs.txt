'Gilded Alchemy'
by
Anita Sexton



How eternity rescind   
The humble in affection!   
I now lay down sonnet   
Who purpose at ceramics. 

But I rest sump.   
manque broth of a boy 
Whose small appointment tumefy   
With unskilled stochasticity, 

scorn me non! 
And be not manic   
To eulogy mildly:   
epos is not available. 

But flip one's lid who will 
continuum that copyright me   
complete signified and virtuosity   
Of lunacy seasoned me.
