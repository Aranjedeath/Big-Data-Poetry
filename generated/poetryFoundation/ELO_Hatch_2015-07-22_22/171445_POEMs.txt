'transit sic mundi Seizure'
by
Brian Lewis



You are the deep water I advance, 
My devout, the crammer my meditation glose: 
I call-in you for restroom screw. 
By stipulative definition you're an initiate 
understand by gentle legal philosophy 
You are so to the enshrine after 
But in this wraithlike high aliveness 
I nap with a mystical old lady 
And seedless preschooler I sire. 
passion is a canard I essential take, 
A perquisite I can slang, 
And arduously everyone I mind. until in the in darkness felicitous seat 
dote is in the perch judgement 
The whistling twist whose refinement she refinement, 
A trace discarnate, rethink outlined. 
She was so to my familiar seventh heaven, 
She is so while I figure 
The shape my word meaning dig, 
And in the terminus ad quem she will be terminus ad quem. 

Her whom my entrust embracement I smack, 
Her whom my intellect surmise I recognise. 
The nonpareil freewheel in clip and indentation 
And as she was she will not indentation; 
The blooming is in her own blessing 
And is She is evermore. 

Plato! you shall not pest my lifespan. 
I matrimonial an intense honest woman. 
And Jane! she is not e'er masking 
In rotation of notice foundation. 
She has deuce manakin-ah, acknowledge you, Eurydice 
I anticipate her in both path at until 
I know her, no, before I know her, 
And by both denote I essential see her, 
And none despite you shall unbelt her.
