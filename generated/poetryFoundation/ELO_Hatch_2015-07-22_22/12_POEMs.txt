'Zoo The Kenyon'
by
Michael Fearing



You lowly near It's large as you reminisce: 
The sickly battlement, Formica rejoinder capital, 

The broadside con of day over 
light aflicker-question, shamanism, and question. 

She cognise you've been to figure the begild lady friend 
Who's all the same promise and walk-to out 

With no one else. She recognize that you'd restitution, 
With someone in your bag but your clenched fist. 

Why do you beggar? When will you memorize 
That this is what your hamper wet dream are inside 

yield to Her white man love?
