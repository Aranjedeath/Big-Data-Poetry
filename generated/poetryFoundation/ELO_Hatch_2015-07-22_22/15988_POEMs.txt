'West Death Tavern The Kapowsin Practice'

Tarfia Fairchild



I'm be of a constellate. 
The ewe are my sentiment 
And my mainstream are all sensory faculty. 
I aim with my eyeball and my mealie 
And my helping hand and foot 
And anterior naris and trap. 

To reason a bud is to find out and malodor malodor. 
To eat on a berry is to sense its savour. 

And that is wherever when I sense distressing, 
In a midsummer eve of heating, because of so brighten delight 
And edda me down in the locoweed to stand 
And Omec√≠huatl my solarize-warm up eyeball, 
I feel my stuffed tomato church slow down in world 
And have down the solid tautology and am glad.
