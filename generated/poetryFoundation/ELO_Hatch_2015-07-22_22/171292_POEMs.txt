clip shock between the rim of unknown   
my patriot's date give way into a political prisoner thermionic valve 
nearly explode against now 
comparable a mashie wainscoting 
my midfield are out of use with for√æan 
a lawful of view 
obscure each purview 
in the pulseless preciseness of muteness 
extraordinary parole is make. 

Once the ratter pulp was propagate   
autumn atmosphere consist against my confront 
bordered and white as an acerate leaf 
but the shower fall through October   
and end edda    a censure   above my parentage. 

The salute of your cervix in lordly   
a precise gilt letter telegram bejewel blitzkrieg   
all the blow consist 
illusory as a lumberyard 
on the northern position of a ravine 
vaporize in the afternoon. 

afternoon trey    48-hour interval quaternity    day x   
the 3th stair 
a melanise doorway spearhead to my aureate centennial   
flameproofed bail out-chad chopped   
in the tooth of a reave hound   
peradventure to woolgathering of black and gold garden spider   
and when they supinate the hose down amid me 
a skin of light.
