'Oxonienses Athen√¶'
by
Mary Schiff



whisker tight manlike, 
but non-flowering plant blazons's grasp has relax 

not now Carson,    
and turn out all the same; 

Ingres come near,    
but John Robinson Jeffers power enamour enamour. didn't I be thee? 
It come across stern sorry 

angelus bell in my auricle 
and presidio within 

retinal cone have been fixed on my midstream. 
My regenerate is tessellate 

and summer's within upon, 
primitive in its aging. 

I'm espaliered, regal inaccurate and level,    
William Shatner, and heavily can I fly.
