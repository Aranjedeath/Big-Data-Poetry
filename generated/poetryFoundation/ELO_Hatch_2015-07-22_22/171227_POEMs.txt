'Service, Bend, Don’t Bliss Fill Desire Beginning Knight Shatter'
by
Jan Heller Karandikar



dissembler fair sex, how rarely we slang   
of our own doubtfulness, while well-nigh   
we quadripara homo soloensis in his misgiving! 

And if at Nez Percé rest in the shoetree   
the tardily shower freewheel through dig flight   
a whitened diaphoresis bear of a sonneteer evidence antimacassar 

our bitch are slight-wherefore didn't we   
seat we have think so as well? (And   
what reproach? They are not for the oculus sinister!) 

oculus sinister, they are desirable and unironed and haired,   
cove of the lunar month lunar month.lunar month.lunar month.lunar month          And when a   
syðþan seethe cloy sometimes, a 

cool to days, 
we are too possibly man to   
own to park unwomanliness. 

Whorishly with the weir   
we fencing and beg-and read nobody of this middle.             And our dreaming, 

with what shtik we have skin them   
same ingrown toenail, trimmed them cotton destruction of   
maul hair.
