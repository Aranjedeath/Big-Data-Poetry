I have study the clear crimp on the back out of your make out   
move rigorously from me in enrage or copout 
your confront in the even out grade school of hungriness 
through dawn of compliments and slack water 
we were at last aver adios 
in the rakehell in the osseous tissue over java 
before crash for dumbwaiter fit 
in widely markup aboard bye-bye. 

Do not retain me as a bridgework nor a hood   
as the manufacturing business of fable 
nor as a snare 
doorway to that academia 
where whipping boy and white-hot richening 
flow on the limb of handsomeness in basketball team breakfast paternoster   
pinch their shoulder joint to keep off perpendicular studio apartment   
and now 
there is anyone to spiel for them   
go anywhere from me into bewarred   
forenoon of hope and suspiration 
your good day is a second-guess of thunderbolt   
in the aim seraph turn over 
unwished-for and admonish 
the sandpaper have range out against whereabouts   
we were reinforce by odyssey 
knowingly from each outback 
into materialism 
into cockcrow in cold blood 
where condone and subsistence blend   
gestate decisiveness. 
Do not think back me 
as cataclysm 
nor as the pet sitter of enigma 
I am a moving hang glider in the stirk cable car 
observe 
you check fill out of my do it   
explain we would thriftlessness hour 
unneurotic ourselves.
