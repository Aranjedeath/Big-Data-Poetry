'du Mal Esthetique Jacket'

frigid weave issue forth out of the national guard James Jerome Hill 
and snag itself against the fence in of the chough   
with an all-night schwa healthy, 
and an aloneness weirdie 
into the tete-a-tete by the skilled tubful. 

We don't have it coming luxuriation 
intimately as we don't merit irritant, 
but it's saturated diabolism the access the square of near haze over   
hold move up from the plaster of the bilge 
to coil themselves without a sculptured 
collarbone or radiocarpal joint. 

It's not constantly that we are on 
the 2th tarradiddle of the closed universe 
looking for out through pyrex and nerve 
with a translucence of eyesight 
in which foreign deep brown and 
a perception of herculean grain grain
grain                                              are coalesce, 

but that we are vast an avaricious 
of all the matter of fact that defecate this conspicuous:   
the forge that geothermal energy the flowage,   
the van that cart the gas up, 
the arteria of beltway 
shell through the volcano, 

the mettle flare of the day by day renter,   
the recital of true statement telescope   
that strike out to at him, 
the sheet developing of touristry, 
the play false ovalbumin liniment that countervail the chemical science   
of Cl in hide-our peel. 

Down concerning history's bodywork, 
the hard worker are so hum in the Hedeoma pulegioides;   
the royal road head to be build; 
the wind waft and the progress pinch itself   
in life expectancy of the  butterflies ev'ry sandblast. 

So an enforce play of mind is forbid   
simply to snog everybody 
or to Sung dynasty your oral cavity 
for the twig of low-Calorie pat√© somebody is raise to your sassing, wherever onto the death toll,   
it will be a fall   
not to enjoy.
