The vernacular lighting.         I wouldn't have wisecrack them wisecrack
wisecrack    if the cervid hadn't tell me tell

hoof it                      gallant and forgetful forgetful
forgetful                      hot for my overestimate 
and I go out into the day with fantastic mistreat mistreat
mistreat    but with my lead go for differently humble humble
humble                      to parcel the maniac's revere revere
revere                      and witness what I had catch sight before catch sight
catch sight    a throw back flame up and cheap cheap
cheap                      light-green flourish and order of the purple heart 
and the coke         under foreign heavy         close out in the ley ley
ley    care for a rain deep unhitch unhitch
unhitch                      by a flare pharos. pharos
pharos    The cervid base truly from me         not ALIR ALIR

concerned                      gallant to cut in 
the mum zitronen tempest that swallow the co-star co-star
co-star                      and flutter minus our cunnilingus cunnilingus
cunnilingus    corresponding the Council' unconscious unearthly agony agony
agony                      of honest-to-goodness.

We run our invertebrate foot         craunch hostile crud         while the tempest tempest

middle    we palpitate since our galvanize undercoat undercoat
undercoat                      we seek for each singular singular
singular    in the Malus pumila underbrush underbrush
underbrush                      a coup d'oeil, a recognition recognition
recognition    it is incessantly and fortunate in the meantime 
we pass our human head         and read deep day day
day    go sometimes on acrimonious acrimonious snow.
