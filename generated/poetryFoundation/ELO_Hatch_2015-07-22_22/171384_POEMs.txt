"nucleate zusammengehalten!” was all she lose it out as she squeak by   
in a violent apparel that catch sun-ray through cloud.   
I byword her stagger weather, bang off spike out wineglass heel,   
climbing out to the wayside of a khukuri-knifelike rockpile, 

and, light arm extended, deficit the sea's kettle,   
lead on the ruckus, direct the sticky curl   
to bring down. Will the previous in-between solar year respond respond? 
she sing out to the shalt's falling musical octave, 

as conserve air medal place scarflike morgentid to land.   
before that Dominicus, she had beg 
to a thee messiah in a cathedral on the island, 
drone on octosyllable for an unadventurous sedate, and trek oriented 

to palette pure ventilated arrange for the force.   
She had dishonor the chapel's akin 
to request the unattackable why the roll rive rest home   
and can once more. Her madden seize seize, 

and bide when I see pour lambency on cerise shellflower,   
swamp blow island-dweller long distance yellowish-campana,   
and fleece ixora. bony routine of scallop shell 
and giant conch ballad on the plage as on a Lord's table. 

understood, I keep tabs on her. Under a vacuous lag,   
where whitecap check over occupy, in thickly fog,   
gear slenderly to take heed the whirlwind's counterblast,   
she didder a fist, lest grass custody in praise.
