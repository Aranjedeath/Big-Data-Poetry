There is no windlessness in this woods. 
The tranquillity of this hop 
Is the weak of my catch 
The dub I does 

There is no visual modality in this clearing. 
This steeple of Lord's Day telling 
The incontinent lives is stealth 
stuff from spectre. 

Only my goosey is love's perfect. 
The honey I does not happen upon 
In these corner know the score no fancy man, 
Is the artificial, 

The vague, unanalysed, 
Unabsolute with 
It is haloed of whatsoever, 
In no one comprised.
