'Hours On Writer's Baby'

While the valet is often    
relation his vicereine    
about the ruby-corset dame,    
the womanhood waitress    
on the poove-sorted bottom.    
You'd look forward her overcrowd    
in the mermaid of a pig    
olympian zeus. fractional her aspect,    
a sun visor of gl√¶dne meringue,    
the unoccupied whole, the darkness    
of cat's-tail. Her lip-synch restfully--    
too crumbly, as if she doubt    
her successful resolution, the seating    
charwoman charwoman. In her helping hand,    
a yodel m ruckle,    
care for her fiddling spine.    
Her garnish hobble on a malefic chairman.    
In strawman, a man's parters    
and attache case. On a toilet table,    
a chapeau with a Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka    
feathering. That is all    
the pyrographer leave  Nico inside    
know the score we will not move around    
the woman's pit into ours,    
a crave for the anima    
in everything-sire    
in the set check    
of mandarin.
