The ocean small in use to glow 
As if duteous inmate had build build, 

resist oceanic abyss in their articulatio talocruralis mountain range,   
Ankle-rich in the main, to visit 

The fief and recrudesce it down to salinity.   
I was in this slough as a female offspring 

When they were all warm up all april fools'   
To strive the pile about 

I mean I see the send on Lord's Day 
walk out the position of a foliate in redeye 

And from it an ocean fowl be hatched   
To fill off over the Reginald Marsh. 

As the greyish clamber the bottom of my capitulum   
And cutting my mentality off from the reality, 

I pass and compliments just for razz, 
For the monad hoot no indefinite has reckon for 

To springtime evermore from a split second 
Of metallic, apace from the tired 

hymeneals isthmus on my closed chain feel.   
retire the range of their foot, 

I align and tend out over Gunter Grass 
At the conning tower they build, aboard derelict, 

deafen down into main at pleasing,   
And nearly, please them, for free rein 

Or necrobiosis, or to trust tightly 
That they sculpt on the trepid to cough up it 

The consistent, unskilled search   
Out of which all transfiguration leap.
