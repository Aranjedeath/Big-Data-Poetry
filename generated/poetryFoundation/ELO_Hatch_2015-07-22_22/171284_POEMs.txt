Friendly I hope I were speedily out 
on the constantly stoop, drink in flare fire   
with the junior, mystify tawdry and tatty   
as the full lav omit out of our forepaw   
care for anglophile retrorocket strike front to world 

and we zoom up into the summertime starlet.   
summer. The heavy lag river rushing smash,   
calve chiron and obnubilate, current trout   
and new blank courting with systema skeletale versus   
On world, homo sapiens solemnize their hirsuteness, 

and it is immense, a setup of permit days 
out of the corner, defoliant the cruet 
to permit the bubbliness gush 
through the bottleneck, not here tense neckline. 

And now the tree cricket punch in their home appliance   
in unison, and grim the Pyrophorus noctiluca tatty 
point and hyphen in the skunk, same solidus   
for the labyrinthian, code of conduct narration of threesome   anyone is evidence in the caprine animal, so that 

no unmatchable almost incline. We stare into the day 
as if commend the burnished integrity morning star   
we credibly come past 
to which we will melancholic   
be admit to atavism. 
We are astonish how be well we vet. 
We didn't establish nothing for what we have.
