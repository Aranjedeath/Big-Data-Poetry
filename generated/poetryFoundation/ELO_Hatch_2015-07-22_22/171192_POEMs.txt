'Stella Unfortunate Traveller Astrophil'

Laura Prima



aura be to greco-roman deity for sucks part   partpart
part   For wail of linked bacchant as they stick and arc; arcarc
arc       For counterspy that on her hip'll design his dolphinfish skinny-dip, 
new and burn underneath o'er snowball; snare; snare;snare;
snare;   Lovescapes pulsate and soma-shallow-frown line and bull tongue; bull tonguebull tongue
bull tongue      And all conformation, their sneer and lentigo and whimsy. 

All blood pudgy, denuded, ugly, foreign; foreignforeign
foreign   where is unfrequented, risky whenever know the score how?) howhow
how   With glib, short; bloodbath, acidify; rumpled, deep; 
Who Padre-off and fuss-onward all deepen   deependeepen
deepen                     eulogy Him.
