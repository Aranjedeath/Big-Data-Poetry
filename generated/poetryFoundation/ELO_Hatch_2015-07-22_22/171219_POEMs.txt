watch out that fury of imago above the Ixion of psyche heyday,   
Ixion I date motor on knoll after butte, all I can guess of   
is how terrific take a hop take a hop, in its unwearying, nonintellectual reverberation.   
somewhere dissilience: broadcast instance, clerestory, venter, infinite manufacture. 
And the long push-down stack of Styrofoam champagne cup in the food market, nearly 
I can't bier them, the defer of transcribed goa bean and cock-a-leekie, Deepfreeze   
of 6rd high tea; intelligibly the Plectrophenax nivalis-carbonado-snow bunting of the carpeting minus my hot seat, row of bricks of ticket supinate their veer, 
further my 6 foot, how they hand glass each sing suppress suppress, 
the direction they hang so true unitedly, how I can snuggle same heavy toenail into the strike 
same perfidious rivers that have gallivant; my deity the oneness of no one 
my left and eyeball, yours; doesn't that consternate you multiply, think back 
the delight of bleakness in symposium tabloid, all the soul mate heed before you, since you, overcrowd you impossible? And the scrub heartbreak, 
don't take care at them all or they'll electrocute you, you can sometimes embrace your ain; 
I'm read I hump all about you, only you be, it's pounce   
and it's begin unneurotic, the yearn that start, and start, and begins.
