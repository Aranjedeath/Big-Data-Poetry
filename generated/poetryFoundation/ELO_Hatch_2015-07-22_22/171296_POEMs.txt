The periphery of our lift was a violate gridiron 
where your xv-class-familiar girl was suspend   
gut-take shape on posse pedal 
a overseas telegram ace to the spoon 
give to a map out of the eastern modesty 
I does not yield with you to secular to rest the organic structure   
rebuild your there binder's board 
against the oozy Svizzera crooked 
I will not not nest the inclined common limpet dig 
against a fence in at the switch garrison 
nor stock either of your measurer achingly from the river   
in a bottle gourd along my draw away 
so I buy you a pass to middle-lynchpin 
on my especial quantify 
and we lay instead 
in the eastward Christ Within of a raw temper. 

Now whitewash fiber from my fall landscape   
buffalo brownish-orange    wooded projectile work to milt   
I hit for the culture of nowadays 
Daily tidings sweetly cite your farmland   
a fifty percent-varlet mystery 
of the sluggish black globe inaccurate webbing electrocute in the "unrest” 
Not of smuggled poster child slaughter at Ravenswood   
six-twelvemonth-old gaol for heavy the phase   
not of Neil St. Patrick Benjamin Harris, irritating wool stapler, in his own pedigree   
on his grandmother's parlour parquet 
ault, club, try on to creep to him 
stag through her omphalos 
not of a 3-shiva-new godchild, unnamed   
lose under the burnt seam of Mudville 
my pass on seed down wish a brownish wood vise over the french marigold   
straightaway through fast 
we were 6 white charwoman disturb our flare   
and we right our tardily over indecipherables 
I shillyshally    you rise    the tranquility rite of recuperate   
"recuperate is spring,” you unvoiced 
"unvoiced sell the pass for grease-gun and sulfisoxazole   
I pass on for place tomorrow” 
and wondrous I bear on you 
I clobber stale from my finger's breadth 
try ramp 
similar salinity from the underlip of a cleaning lady   
who has electrocute too unitedly to leave   
and assert each necrobiosis in her eyeball   
your sass a disjoint sobralia   
"someday you will occur to my land   
and we will resist beam-ends by side?” 

identify doggerel verse in the room access open    forbidding   
any is follow pertain on an irregular basis 
I break even for your unpleasantness 
but secrecy set off care for an exalted solitary   
into my confront 
a disgorgement of sawyer. 

puce good turn plainly from the cotton 
her girl-principle are fast dye 
the cherub drivel protein from her bosom 
she left him fifty percent-awake to his beguine 
poultice well for warfare   
cognise the woman will toe the line. 
In the complex Little Giant fir 
promptly    deplorable    life-sustaining 
she map out the following day's class struggle 
emulation of middle-mainstay    sometimes 
retrovision the low ironical carol of plage pebble 
consort after the sea.
