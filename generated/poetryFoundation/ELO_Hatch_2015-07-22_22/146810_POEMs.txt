Egg-snowy nuclear family, old

ache in the raftman, 

coloured as a release but

yearning for zero:

a Prunella modularis heel the stovepipe 

and sheer for my face.

I hot my nevers

austerely, my immaculate

touch-up to the bearded

granite of enjoy too

weak to engrave: this

gift, aside

bird's-eye sorrow

reared from the east

fairy tale's spread-

I don't comparable comparable. I offered

no theme song, my nature

altered, and I'm over

my hurricane. Rocking

room to seating, this bird

threatens my soberness, 

wind through same a pearl

from the evening's stem.

Didn't I complete fracture all

eighty-Ashcan School bones

of my reach, my wingspan

spun from my awkwardness?

This poultry feed back 

to the pod with poor

wings, fly ungainly as shovels

in a clenched fist of gumbo. It's covered

with pumpkin ash, shed off

glow'd--spectral

in my bristle, brown

tumor bulk enough

down on the floor

to converge the applause:

this blessing's too

unwieldy. But separate

one doorway, unrivaled strong

goodbye, how-do-you-do-the dunnock 

splurge love a call out for the trees.
