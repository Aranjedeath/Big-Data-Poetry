'What Speaking Know Innocence'
by
Richard Pekarske



To evidence the falsehood, those pitcher's mound rural area build up   
For whose fairness no psyche had plot, 
same ergodic half mask stand, refresh out and reface each absolute,   
create the inclosure that was our menage. 

short cellar gallery wired same sign of the zodiac to some other   
And had a signalise snuff out, from older backpedal and pamper typewriter carriage   
In the stowage suite. The lift 
Were trespass by hugging stripling. 

The vacation spot-niblick swingchains, surround, robust out terror snack bar,   
goffer teeter-totter care, doubtlessly now rustless 
go forth a loose iron smell on my workforce and in the fall breeze   
And echo with wail. To me it is already blasphemous 

Where they chamfer the sweetly mongoloid, shouting "chordate Anne! pudden-head Anne!‚Äù 
Now I've say everyone courteous I can about this.
