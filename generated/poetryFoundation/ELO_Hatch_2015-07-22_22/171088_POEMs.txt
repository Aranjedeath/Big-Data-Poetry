'Tame Hen Jubilate Tender Agno'
by
John Chasar



Vainly you interpret a drive of cherubic pigs
crossing the interstate. 8 of them
pulling his gaseousness by the look feet,
the back stage shlep flat.
Without thinking,
you read the Pole.
They follow with a web and belong for him.
They were text of detail, uniformed;
there were deuce of them,
their transporter inconspicuous, with a cage.
He was cover in the green goddess. It was easily
you take care his eyeball. He understood.
He was trembling.
After they charter him, you recommence to swelter regret.
Years redundant, you call back his jerk body
scrambling to grasp the others.
Even at this minute, your heart
is lead too rather; your hired hand sweat.
