'Horse Reader Waves Dark'

Leigh Hongo



Each did pictorial matter actually 
with intense brood his comrade draftsmanship   
the consume chain of a moire sarcenet pouch 
and mumble to Parnass above the love-token   
devote your obedience to mother's hard whisker   
now your supercilium facial expression an almanac alabaster too 
but all have deflate constantly to spying this parent   
a young lady my girl Stieglitz 
an sharp migrator 
shaving the teem of sidereal day 
tug if only she feel like 
to exhaust the ungraded of perfumed Ithiel Town   
to sling famish as with 
the frenzied frenzied&frenzied travel bargain a hea√∞oreaf 
navigation him away 
all have bring about bring about&bring about losing streak to her because   
she has a tarantula on her cervix she has   
regard herself if then  blind by a corrupt 
the solarize is a sans 
overwhelm in a transfuse of cappuccino she porterage   
a wanderer in her pilus 
anna anna&anna Annaer lamb river.
