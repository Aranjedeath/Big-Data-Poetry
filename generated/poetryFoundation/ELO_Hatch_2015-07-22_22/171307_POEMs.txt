'Attempted Bodies Soothsayers'
by
Beverley Bie Schulman



My ma-opt the unknown to the tone down: 
Dove-marginalia, the fag, sambar chip, 
Frog's ruthlessly dilate with evilness computerized axial tomography valium, 
Leaf-mould barren, bluebell, mushroom, 
unpaired, nosy plumber's snake ramble through the flyleaf, 
gold overhang sprawling over Oliver Stone: all 
godforsaken and anthem!-wink out her frank hate, and lullaby, she   
foot up the bat, shed blood paddle the cat set at her foot,   
And deem the short repugnance to the pier glass, where 
He stare on himself, and pipe up same a new window blind threshold immoderate as 

hang by a thread from her puritanic ovolo, each flight 
land clack down like a predictable pitch-dark deadlight. 
sparkling unagitated, she come on, "It's easy infuse ...” 
The philharmonic sneak personify, the dulcet gecyðan flicker 
In the catch oculus dexter. Then we adage, 
And reverberate: adelgid, pale, irregular, 
snuggle off the annex-fossa, sufficiently lactate and drowse.   
The affair hang from her second hand, and with its thump, 
Swiftly, the vomit up, with an almost snowy lip-synch 
conclude on the clean vane, rumble, take them out to the veer huddle. 

But sagely, unoccupied rakehell, a compact pool on the base   
persist, of all my mother's sensitive, bruise ardor   
For a firm baseless, misplace, fail, and classified ghetto   from its hideaway and warren, its lucent gemstone,   
Whose hittite can twist in the admass   
With spatter spit, a smell, talon, nipper,   
To prick or badlands benefaction, foreign 
As our bungling iron trap, our ergodic spray of shoot.   
She broom to the galley. move around on the knock,   
She moisten and clean the care from her helping hand.
