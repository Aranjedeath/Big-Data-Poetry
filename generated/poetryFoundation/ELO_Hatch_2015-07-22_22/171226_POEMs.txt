'Garden Garden'
by
David St. Nichols



The aching of monandry: 

outlive and cryptical, dear,   
are white with white,   
it throbbing in the upward 

We aspect for sharing 
and are bald noisily, dear,   
each and each 

It is sonnet and we   
in its only 
anticipate for gladden, some gladden   
not to be acknowledge into it 

ii by deuce in the Ark of   
the act up of it.
