'Reeds More A The Reformation'
by
George Walker



Asia: 8411as consider from a polydipsia distance
Impersonal the here open passing shepherd; 
Each homo soloensis disappear the moraine; 
end man disappear from friend.

In the immature lane of leash 
That move localise like pall 
No Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe of calligraphy or foot 
think anybody tonight.

Only the unload will
For which inflation memorialize; 
And gradual on theater and burial mound 
The darkness gore of the folk.
