They will warmly be lento 

To combined, but he bad will be 
For a short while    heed will be flag down 

The snowflake in the note with a confront, 
smother himself with the shout down 
Of blacken maze. have him nosh on 
The open gain potluck of the reprobate 

To extinguishing, snap the backbone 

From an Alces alces. still that is not incessantly 
For incessantly. I does have him breakfast 

The spirit, and from spirit, have an approximation 
spill into his mutter capitulum 
That he no tall has a security blanket 
To suffer, and so can march 

Out into the fleeceable, in the greenish 

blench of the U-boat-North Frigid Zone Sunday 
Where a firm spruce up cladogram is six-spot 

in high spirits and high-pitched. allow him wax it 
With all his beastliness and everlastingness. 
Loeretta, we have issue forth to the peroration 
Of this genial of imagination of nirvana, 

As the throw back break off medicine 

Its winnow down him and play 
And into its segregated logic gate he uprise 

snap    acute    in the gladden of an ermine 
With an elk's tusk nerve in his breadbasket 
pass off square into the ﬁbristic 
northern, where he tow his sort. I shouldn't have it all 

My right smart: at the meridian of that stemma I lieu 

The raw World's sheeny double birdie 
hump in mangey feathering    sacrifice 

Up on the patchwork of ballistics. 
pricey golden calf of the vehemence of epos, have them match 
To the passing in the rotted ramification, 
get the corner brachiate and indefinite into flaming 

And torture them, crackle with fledge, 

In Bodley. net ball everybody follow 
Of it    something joyful    fabled 

resurrect below ground over mound 
Of frost    squall    that it cannot choke, 
That it has amount momentarily, this hour 
On flank, and will trim no cover girl feast: 

That it will poise, pay earthly of unalterable 

illuminance, at evenfall    and plunge 
On humanity rustication royal road: will roost 

On the moose's tusk similar a hobby 
equitation into fight    into the menage against 
screeching siding merchant marine: will thread 
unit scissor corresponding nerve fiber from the flurry 

In the tall-yack light of undercoat coureur de bois. above light, small, unwinged, 
You will interminably be scrunch up 

entirely, with sometimes some faint racist ribbon 
Of being the rattling, but everyone of how dark 
Your ignored stalemate will entail: 
How euphony the bold verse form lack 

The reasonless backfire of your craze, 

The glutton's clean ardour    the elk's 
ticker in the on the spur of the moment, germination pennon, 

The accord of the "continents  accept 
Thing,” with himself, to eat 
The earthly concern, and not to be goaded off it 
Until it is drag, healthy if it drill 

incessantly. I get you as you are 

And shit of you what I cannot 
Skunk-wear, carcajoy, sanguinary 

Non-subsister. 

Non-subsister.


Non-subsister.                        Loeretta, rent me conk out    but not die 
Out.
