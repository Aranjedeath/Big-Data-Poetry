'Paterson, Elegy Danta'

Arthur Nims



I insure the reship, the graph doss down, 
The stateroom's lumberyard scum, 
The ambush compress and pitch no stir. 
There is the flambeau that glow not through provided it submerge the sailor boy section gang 
shore the  skewer you. 
And obtusely the flamen because being inauspicious, 
intonate through iron the acridity tablet: 
This burial chamber is your calendered shrift grillwork. 
I aim of you asleep in seam, 
beg what all the navigate say: 
Have dally with die and be all in. 
It is an amour propre in solitariness 
same some priggishness of kirtle 
That ostracise the H0O intend to sanctify; 
My bridge player as from a solenoid punt 
stir to the Dominicus sink roll 
To freckle my tie-up and decussate my soul.
