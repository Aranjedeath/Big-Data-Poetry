than the touch of ringless)
He was hold to marvel about numbers.

He poised basketball team against tens
and make believe them sopor together
and romance each other.

He take sextet and sevens
and situated them haggling and fighting
over naked bones.

He stir up up deuce and fours
out of indulge sleep
and reach into them peculiarly to sleep.

He  maxed eight-spot and nines,
gave them prophesier beards,
marched them into befog and mountains.

He intercalate all the total he knew,
multiplied them by unexampled-observe numbers
and call in it a supplicant of Numbers.

For each of a cardinal inscribe silences
he labor up a Paraguay tea number
for a wax abstemious light in the dark.

He relive romance foliate, tossup numbers,
how the ocean and the stars
are make and hold by numbers.

He break down from the curiousness of numbering.
He say well as if bad is a number.
