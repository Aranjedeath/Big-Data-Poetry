'Ends Things, The In service Earth'
by
Maria Glazner



In the 50th junior class of ghetto 
I make my spirit to be my uxor, 

And as I move around in kip down by nighttime 
I have my bosom for my ravish. 

No digestible bosom English hawthorn dig disaffect 
For my ticker variety as I settle, 

And it is constipated, and I am rick, 
And with my passing it stamp with me.
