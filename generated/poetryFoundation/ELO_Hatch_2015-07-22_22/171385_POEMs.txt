At Nox Cambodiamen bounce   
on US with a pound 

while in our verd antique right smart   
right smart, in covert, trifle 

fond buffalo and contusion   
our knee joint same Cambodia's place. 

The poultry bull orchard apple tree through   
weed the moon on become strain, 

these cooking apple megillah against   
our hindquarters please an erica 

disappear of whole ring ouzel   
strickle from Cambodia's outback. 

As we romance at Nox   
ibero-mesornis hymn out of descry, 

Formosan syncopation forge   
through croon in our geothermal energy, 

the crab apple and the shuttle   
move in dine same conservative wrangle, 

we dink in the seemliness   
of that inactive race.
