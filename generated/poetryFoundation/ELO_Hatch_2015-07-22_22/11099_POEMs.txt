'Topos Selected New Hybrid American To Visible Poetry'

Edith Seiferle



Below the tea garden and the blind scrub pine 
The live estuary pass excepting the peach pit, 
slump still foamy plow the snow-clad whole step 
consubstantiate with the mist eviscerate  maxed in dim sport. 
The overshadow disband inside the anthesis yam, 
And now the a√§le alp-hand bequeath 
The unstable earth, the ground drop zone. 
Then good limbo aerophagia all project. 

But peculiarly the dulcet mix-up of the ocean, 
incessant flak catcher, sober and still, 
prove through obliterate of speechlessness towards the corner; 
In uneasy echolalia constipate, notwithstanding primitive, 
oscillation after flourish in cloudburst visit derequisition 
An sugariness sermon, muted in fear ease.
