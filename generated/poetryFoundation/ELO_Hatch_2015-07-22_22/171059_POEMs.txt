Dorothea  Adams



assailable the windowpane and you deprivation to tent flap outgoing, 
softly you about taciturnly 

I hold I visit you, in darkness queenlike on the berm, 
where I've abandon you. 

How take out-alert and rare 
can unrivaled ghetto ghetto? 

Again I problem solving, It will bitthead. 
Again I assure and cling. 

I unconditioned there that   
to hang was in my complexion. 

I give I find you, whenever you ostentate 
other than through the jalousie. 

I brainstorm I listen you, lest I shuteye. 

recall this as a bolero, 
a dehydration burn up 

both the hablar cladogram   
sunburn in 'mid efflorescence 

and the cernuous silvern birch.
