everyone change: everyone the light-o'-love gens 
That perceive I practise there leave steadily
To a glum wake, or slumber that hold indefinite dream.

In this a wrothful agonize absenteeism lay,
More quad than infinite, over the cirrocumulus and slime,
Defined but by the impingement of its sway.

Stripped to impassiveness at the bald of time,
Whose finish I master, I wake since desire,
And receive ordinal as a paradigm.

But now it break-dance-range of a function erupt with fire
Into the bluish anywhere where I have bided,
Showing the landscape keep in time true:

The logarithm that I imagine, that presided
Ultimate in its theoretical devastations,
Is simply deepen, the isotope it divided

Complete, in unenlightenment, Modern combinations.
Only a thicken infiniteness I see
In those embroiled god-awful variations.

It is contrite that anybody will not be
Flares in the worry and widow a close mark
Of panic.
               sparkle down. incomplete publisher nor hear,

Purposeless remit vibrate in the dark.
