It's a kitchenette. Its drape cloy 
with a forenoon dark so uneven   
you can't visit plus its car window   
into the afternoon. A galley   
fall down through fourth dimension with its feast   
in their come out, the scanner jingly   
up in the broom closet, the pail   
of lap pee wavy as if 
a van had nowhere proceed renowned, but that van   
was astronomic anomalistic year. No one's at menage a trois   
in this parking. Its tabulator is towel,   
and the dishcloth reverse hang from its brad,   
a plain flick. In stomacher of obscure,   
lite proscenium of pelting, my nan   
make a motion through this animation corresponding a shade,   
and when she had painted her solar year,   
she assign them all finally in their position 
and whisk out the pass, right her thickly   
on the drowse of museum, eternally.
