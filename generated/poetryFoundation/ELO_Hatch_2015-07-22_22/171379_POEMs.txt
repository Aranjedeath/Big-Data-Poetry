"direct patently no salve in Gilead?” So watchword   
grim Gary in chew chant.   
"not here is a zinc ointment in Gilead,” counter   
a pickaninny unearthly. The barytone 

who intone intone, proclivity quite on the launching pad,   
hang on between not anticipate his vox is a line storm   
that gargle aerate to excavate little's blindside. 
nowadays, the summertime malfunction, quartet merovingian butterfly, 

their breed's subsister, suckle a flower's macabre blooming,   
open up their fender, orangish-and-lightlessness vein glassful,   
and typeset on the lag in crank product line, 
witness shiny least ascend: wintertime moonshine, the inedible bilge   
of a Magnolia State andean condor, abominably think fated, 
now dither whatsoever similar the letter telegram birdie from ashes.
