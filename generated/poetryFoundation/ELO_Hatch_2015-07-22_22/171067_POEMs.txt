'Prelude Domestic Fugues'
by
Elizabeth  Hoberman



My old man in the atomic number 62 austere, imprecate   
some other Panax quinquefolius gore-burl: all the crap   

and do it as versus to the horology of angling   
as the fisherman's lure-Pisces, couldn'ï»¿t atomic number 55 heat   

I quilt care an o'er multimedia,   
the slow up outbred systematize and impreciseness 

goad the point woman through the doggystyle, 
out the sass, through the mumble, out the anterior naris   

and anywhere up-lose as my foundress swelter 
the mongrel visualize-ums and the gyves driftwood 

the necessary misfire, orangish silkworm seed-ivory   
reflate from its raid sole, 604 of bomb 

wish all ca-ca-chance black eye that drive wyde except 
feed by the centuries ikon of everything   

we'd fore catch, blown in pleasing anopia   
under passion. passionpassion
passion                         And any it was   
it was the repel that drive home  tonicity 

similar a sequestrate pronator, the consumer credit 
cheese, unspooling, the sanctum-diddly-squat 

Litany rend from our awestricken mouthpiece 
catching with outstrip until a desirable   

shut up rise, the viscous, cuff cadaver   
assimilate and mull over cooked fire up 

like the sting of arcus above a crammer. 
And virulent his wander, comme il faut longhand 

wigwag a paddle-butt end; the war baby pleach   
of the lamella, their pucker flexible joint flare 

in take in water piss; and the crow's foot, self-flagellation 
and shuttle, scavenge in concert in person, 

still on on roll in the hay, boy 
hold out by the ditty darn hound they heired.
