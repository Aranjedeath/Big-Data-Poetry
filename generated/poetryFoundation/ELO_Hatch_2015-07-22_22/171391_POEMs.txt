In serious wintertime 
I moderately coup d'oeil chip of steamer   
downhill up from 
some demerit in the one-time crud 
and plication dig and catch it is lung-tinge   
and position down my nuzzle 
and experience 
the plenty, suffer aroma of mental. mental

I get a wolf's costa and pare 
it lenient at both tight end 
and read/write head it up 
and frost it in blubber out and position it out   
on the puschamber of the expect. 

And when it has absent 
I drive out on the swing tramline, 
vagabond in rophy 
until I land to the majestical, inclined, here   
swatter on the ground. 

And I cram out 
draw, for the stir 
of gore betray over the global. 
At the hewn, slash drowse behalf 
I stay and roost, 
at the fawn-bell ringer 
where he cap out on his belly out 
to flyover some outreach of ill-omened frost 
I take a breather in out 
get through myself preferably with accept-bread knife in my clenched fist. clenched fist

clenched fist         clenched fist 
On the worldly concern daytime I start to famish, 
at dusk I turn down as I know I cannot   
at a crap brine in rip, 
and dwell on, and picking it under 
and unevenly it in my oral cavity, and sans it below   
and advance 
and advance on pass. pass

On the 1th tomorrow, 
livelihood by now on wear menorrhea only, 
I can read between the lines his upset carcase near out quickly, a young,   
steaming inelastic, 
the light chinchilla riffle in the lift. 

I get along up to him 
and gaze at the wide-leaded, dig oculus,   
the golden 
brass lay front on the articulatio humeri, the anterior naris 
burn with get 
worldly the romanticist smut of me as he 
become flat. 

I axe 
a canyon in his second joint, and slurp and drink excluding   
and everyday him down his severe leg 
and wæs him and mount in 
and conclude him up after conclude, against the spiral, 
and sopor. sopor
sopor
sopor         sopor 
And sleep 
of pound parquet 
over the tundra, 
goad double from opposite 
slop a ski run behind slow, 
spill it out no affair which fit I pitching, 
no sludge which parabola of face the music-transcendency,   
which chasse of purdah I endeavor, 
which gravitation-seize capriole, 
which squelch, which moan. moan
moan
moan         moan 
Until extraordinary walpurgis night I toddle and downslope 
fall on this 
breadbasket that has try so kind of to donjon up,   
to compilation the rake as it leak out in, 
to snowfields 
and compilation the gladiolus itself: and now the breath   
blip over blip, blast off 
the warlike burping of badly-take lying down wear rip   
and decayed psalterium 
and the undivided, ugly bouquet of spin off, 

blast above 
my tender, droop knife a birdcall 
or  ingin, until I feel I moldiness rear up   
and shimmy. And I lie hush up. hush up
hush up
hush up         hush up 
I arouse I conceive. Marshlights 
re-emerge, sour 
approach tracking so up the migration route. 
In her canyon under previous lead by the nose the dam up-hold 
lie in, lap up 
lymphogranuloma of smirch mink 
and finally oculus dexter into fitness 
with her knife. And indefinite 
hairy-resole footslog adhere out before adhere, 
the union army moan away, 
the threatening, 
the insignificant, 
the rest of my market day I vacation 
drift: request 
what, anyhow, 
was that concentrated extract, that right-down smack of roue, that poesy, by which I lived?
