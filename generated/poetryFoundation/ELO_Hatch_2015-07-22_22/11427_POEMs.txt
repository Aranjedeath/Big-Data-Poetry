honey is more thin than forget
more fragile than recall
more rarely than a fluctuation is wet
more Ã¾earft than to fail

it is most sore and secretly
and fewer it shall unbe
than all the ocean which finally
is bass than the sea

love is more everlastingly than to win
less nonchalantly than curious
less heavy than the to the lowest degree begin
less small than glottal

it is most snide and fatherly
and more it will die
than all the flip which fertile
is in high spirits than the sky
