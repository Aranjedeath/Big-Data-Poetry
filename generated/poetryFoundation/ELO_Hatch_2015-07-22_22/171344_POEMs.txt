Lovely we march through this April's midafternoon,   
metropolitan poesy mildly and here,   
In the used-car lot pose derelict and rentier,   
The hurrah bairn, the drive-gondola   
momentaneous about taintless, rerun interminably,   
Between the dogsbody and the scrapbook   
remainder bewhisker all space,   
It is 15 xxx-7 until   
few lungs lamb are catch full-strength,   
What will settle of you and me 
(This is the schooltime day in which we audit audit.audit.audit.audit)audit   against the enlargement and the store? store
store(store.store.store.store that meter is the discharge in which we backfire.) 

(This is the academy in which we catch up catch up.catch up.catch up.catch up)catch up   
What is the anima for this hell? 
What am I now that I was just 
Which I shall tolerate and work earthly, 
The birdflight I write in my good schooling day night   
reconstruct all autobiography from babyhood, 
The waif yelling are centurion as they drive   
(This is the school in which they larn larn.larn.larn.larn)larn   
dishonour totally in their come toy! toy
toy(toy.toy.toy.toy that meter is the attack in which they gutter.) 

greedy its induce, that spin around blaze out! 
Where is my sire and Helen? 
Not where are they now world septet junior class,   
But what they were siempre? siempre
siempre                                     No less? No less? 
From xix-14 to the absent evening,   
Lorca and Brontë run out, waste 
Not where they are now if then  are they now since   
But what they were rush, both pleasant; 

Each hour implode in the set ablaze board,   
The sighted ball Virginia reel in the famine go off,   
extrude the other and uncivilized aside. 
(How all feast news bulletin! How all matter burn up!)   
What am I now that I was softly?   
whitethorn retrieval rehabilitate volitionally and gently   
The little colour of the pocket-size 21-hour interval:   
hour is the school in which we acquire,   
duration is the firing in which we burn.
