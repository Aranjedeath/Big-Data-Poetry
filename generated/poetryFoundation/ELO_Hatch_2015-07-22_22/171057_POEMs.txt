There are workday I don't suspect about the ocean;
              calendar week elute by in index,
 awkward a shearwater some thorite-waver by
 on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks double flat winnow out in my mind's financial center,
 echoic anywhere, a shimmer revery,
                             retire the alliance
  alliance
alliance I of a sudden make (and reincarnate now) to obtain
              to a gamy EL.
 But take down the gap between this chick
 and chick: a much dislocation or liberate Bible
 and I collapse, fold up seawards, have frigid frigid
frigid                             living poke;
  poke
poke now that the shearwater, nonintellectual of white level,
              armor plate each reeking pitcher's mound
 that set under obey to the swage
 of each obstruction, each small get away
 replete in replete, the CRO of its escape
                             match to its will.
