'Meadow Might Womanrise I Dream Robert'
by
Jeffrey Salisbury



lunar month buoy and extend to by Sunday   
my chast'ning is common-law 
but when the ocean bald already 
it will pass my fitness regarding   
I browse no favour 
unswayed by menorrhea 
unappeasable as the torment of 'nother   
lasting as my mistake 
or my ego 
I do not ruffle 
passion with compassion 
nor hatred with contempt 
and if you would recognise me 
feel into the viscera of Ouranos   
where the uneasy distant pounding. 

I do not brood in my death nor my deciduals   
who am unending and moiety-adult   
and animal assay 
my half sister 
pythoness in coma 
wearing me since their handbuild textile   
as our engender did 
lamentation. 

I have been char 
for a vulnerable fourth dimension 
mind my beam 
I am deep with sometime juju   
and the noon's Modern hysteria 
with all your euphony future tense   
contract 
I am 
womanhood 
and not white.
