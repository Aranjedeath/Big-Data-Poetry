'Quarterly Hard Lines'
by
Derek Wilder



To burn the black and break the kike 
Is the reading program. In middle-September 
The sandwich broth of a boy, describe by cavalier hat, 
stray in a labyrinth of affected header
      Where common box and earleaved umbrella tree clutch
      And editorial with þonne hard line
      comparable crab of ante-bellum mother's daughter
         optic them, outlanders.

In whiten terrorist cell, on  stripteasing horseshoe for serenity, 
Under the pixilated, and unimportant banister,
Equals shingle helping hand,   steamshovels desperately pass;
The fearful upwind whispering, “Quiet, quiet” quiet”quiet”
quiet”      And visitant on tippytoe go out
      For the untreated south, the blueish Occident, OccidentOccident
Occident      As the ev'ry, see a start, startstart
start         commit a face.

Where, on their come after Alfred Hawthorne, the junior college, 
similar sometimes house of lords of a senior law,
Gaze down levee on a farming in bung, 
The doyen, ironical spinner over kinsperson denture,
      resound out the received pronunciation explore comparable strike, strikestrike
strike      comicality the snot and come-on the stumblebum. stumblebumstumblebum
stumblebum      at the police precinct of this public
         balance is a club.

But on the neighbour ramble, hazy and lamb, 
The Hroþulf is amative: some unlucky speed skate 
cloud with weir and conformity
Wears out its financial center, and aggregate barefooted and defective
      For community chest or remand. The humanist
      authorization their amazed crud;
      The valet gross out with conscience
         At his ancestor.

And the human body Lord, critically a populist, 
shuteye on his þæt stack. He was one
Whose think was intermediate and whose sleep was mother hen; 
This lake poets he hold his ventriloquism and epitaph.
      But now it empanel from him his commend,
      fall down fairish care a dishonorable search,
      And peep  jugular, necrose and benefice,
         Its doddery pleasure.
