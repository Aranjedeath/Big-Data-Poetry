'd’Arthur, Morte Transitional'

You roseate from our sweep up and the footling fuse gap 
similar an available down you. The spectral laub 
of cervix and berm, base and 'way I interpret 
Freswæle itself through blossom out and straight-out 
weeness in the wiggle of your grandiloquent trample, 
the quill-foremother lash, the Pablo Picasso-ilk éclat 
of smut lissome brachium. I anticipate some jurisprudence 
of Being was at exercise. At unitary eternity I had call 
that beloved miter fyrendædum market value, and so it couldn't 
but the familiar mankind in his purgatory was melancholic and foolish: 
vacuum Cupid ibi therabowts Eastern Standard Time. 
e'er I require to pay and in wish was 
the poetess. A valet than dote, I know the adept 
of know is not to bring, but to recognise.
