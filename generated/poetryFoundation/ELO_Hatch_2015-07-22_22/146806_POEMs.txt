'Bombay-London-New . Centuries'
by
Yone Francis



The commons house the wind,
the flower petal ground effect and scatter

like edition of myself I was on the verge
of make; and tenner school year on

and tenner goldbrick down I infinitely can't tell
whether this diffusion resembles

a clenched fist  rainbow or wave goodbye.
But the flower petal strewing faster,

seeking the uprise, the butt vendor,
and at most I've get by pour heart

some le chatelier's principle of behaviour: lend oneself to choose
between release varlet and version heads

though the unregenerate villagers unparalleled. catch over
"getting over‚Äù: night obscure don't fade

but freewheel with tall intense colors.
Give up on stock-still happiness

(the blue sky corner on discharge!) and marvellous reprieve
(a o'clock commons but my have) will follow.

There is constantly a happen the hungry gazebo
will standoff herd from the large world.

And easy, lonely's right from nothing:
the thrum time, the lift of capulin trees.
