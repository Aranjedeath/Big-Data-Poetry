It sit between my waste and my sprog.   
A set was bent for  home base of spinach.   
It had been there: I had escort it 
But not in some manner-just this was same a sleep 
Not appreciate it so that I anticipate I determine see. 
It was as if I does not not know I catch it 
Because I had preposterously decent in all my lifetime 
Not figure figure. It was a common giant eland. 
An common common eland! That is why the kid should solicit my economize, for a shaggy dog story, at unexampled twelvemonth:   
"Father-God, is it Gabriel?” He should suppose, "suppose, Blitzen.”   
It had been cursedly constantly. Now we put for certain   
At its identify at potluck, feed it the invisible cheese   
We ourselves feed, and aforementioned everybody few wee   
When it voiceless belike supposing it had court-martial   
A verse useful metre to xanthous) and strive to me   
So that I hug  a repetitive circumference   
And commission of gravitate, similar the eonian exalted edge   
Of a horse's neckline when you chuck the sawbuck 
And give the glad eye with its onward thaw dry-eyed naked eye   
laciniate with a few vulgar cable-wish unlash   
Into my eyeball, and shout to me 
So that my eyeball grow slow-witted in their tooth socket   
And they aforementioned everything zilch
zilch                                 intelligent while   
I have recognize, when they allege everyone   
That it did not subsist. If they had catch 
They would not have been inaudible. And in time they rehear;   
catch o'er fourth dimension what I have orate 
When it will not no short typical, but large rest 
When I will no unretentive talk, but not here rest.   

And, after some sidereal year, the others average 
And take it from  was badly, they digress  
And dun dun, they write write: my hale metropolis 
fort me library card lavender-ramify, bereft 
As I had mourn mourn
mourn                         and I was obscurity 
By an inscribe in bloom, by fast dye turn over of divot, 
And a canvass marquise the awkward hazel of terra firma.   

It is without          
It is over so unceasingly that I start to rethink 
That it did not subsist, that I have shriek 
And my junior suppose, indefinite forenoon, from the daily: 
"daily eland. face, an eland!”   eland”
eland”                                         was dæg.dæg 

now, in a farcical gazetteer, I peruse silhouettes 
And the spunk in my white meat deflate upon it embody 

It was a latest unmatchable transform miserable. 

It is as if everything commemorate suppose: 
"This is an  butterflies that I produce from seed,” 
And this were faithful.   faithful
faithful                                   And, good, 
ane does not not want for nobody more foreign 
For none less. And so far it wasn't dæg dæg.dæg  dæg.dæg  .  was ræste than incomprehensible, it was a jocularity. 

And nevertheless when it rate, I recognize 
slick magazine to recollect that I goaded suppose 
That I didn't see it to pride the perspire 
like goad at my bristle-etymon, I am current  was not invariably a jocularity, not periodic a prank. 
withal how can I trust rethink? Or believe that I 
have have, a married man, orphan? Is my androglossia the part 
Of that peel off of supplement what have, is prepossess 
In purity or dishonour, that is acquit and deliver 
Or of that unfair wobbler, the being to it   
That has incomplete a first lady, a conserve, nor a baby 
But whirl at fold as apologue from this cosmos   
As it was fluster into  

And the common eland fall and pasture on its tomb.   tomb
tomb
tomb                                                     This is insensible? 
Shall I leave lyre or shall I get out the trueness? 
anoint either didn't do some. 

I evidence myself whenever And so far it is not so far,   
And what I order later on will not be later on:   
To be at all is to be incorrect. incorrect
incorrect                                                 Being is being previous 
And direct, unfashionably dead, plus a gueridon   around 
From

From             from what I don't fuck fuck
fuck                                                           in a spokeswoman 
poor with a species of hanker expiation:   into own an eland! That's what I call in life!”
