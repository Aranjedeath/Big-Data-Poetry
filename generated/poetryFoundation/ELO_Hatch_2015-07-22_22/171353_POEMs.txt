After his underact underact&underact clear in the clothe chemical wilding automat,   
having steal by the barefaced merchant vessels bean counter   
to sit a rale lift to the juiced 
where peacenik waver into the magniloquent eaves 
and where cord unbox of away-stylet 
gauze and wreathe won't constantly be 
decorate anyone's solarize living room dialog box. 
Having drowse off in that hideaway he picket 
between quintet iv-sextuplet paperboard stowage cartonful   
while the respite of inconditions load down eminent   
and compound fraise and shower curtain pale similar lunar month,   
and he waken saved 
platen through 
into a reality of unlatched lock sheathed 
unerringly he acknowledge where he is and touch fifty percent kola freak   
and palpate same obliterate some wood pigeon with a catapult. 

That's complete, and that's why he poking 
his cauterise thumb into the fitful mill,   
ducking for tight kooky an incomplete edge difficult 
2 grouchy far I that strong in his air out hole 
and jerk tardily the rub-track tab of internal subway   
with a nut cubbyhole at the s-shape to reception it   
at the conciliatory thorax of a dopy wench. 
Then the racket of squab founder down   
to creosote hardwood, and of necessity a smirk   
the stultify pay me pay&pay all his mellifluous pal up dead.   
And good afternoon reduce down on all   
our hard shoulder, until the lurch sing   
shell, whiff through the plant similar air   
through macrame. As it always have, as it does not   
That vivid. That stunned.
