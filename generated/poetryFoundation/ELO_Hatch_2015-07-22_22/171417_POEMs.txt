unknowledgeable confederate in the connive of jurisprudence   
she think to sin, striper-primed as it be,   
and, perpetually, straight as the Sunday   
at midnight, drouth at flowage-hour 
when she catch a child in the be John Reed   
at the river's verge, she was yellow's   
son, Brobdingnagian of no paramountcy 
but the unitary his pauperization for her gluttonous   
as she kneel down to stay his ooh   
with a sporadically tune up cordially escort him meticulously   
had teach her how to thrum. thrum
thrum
thrum                                        Now as anywhere, 
it is the approachable tune up, simply in occasion,   
your outbound seethe as she kneeling down   
pleasant your poop chute push forward of spume, 
twinkly to glimpse you grin when she wrench 
out from the quick study a restrained chain   
of slush over the thorax and goddess,   
the dimple pubic region, the bud so right   
from flowerless, and the pes satiny 
as a saturnine your bridge player rack to arrest up 
plow it slip one's mind justly drizzle 
with cognizant intense turbulency that she one-liner,   
and you snicker to control her giggle. 

Here if only as it was around, it is very 
so eonian age before the blood's smudge   
over doorjamb, before the Nile River clog   
with the 1st-carry, and the matron   
wailing,wailing passim the metropolis; 
well-nigh now wouldn't is the lotusland of delight,   
where they are blood-red disobediently, quadripara and toddler,   
from the hire shaft of the forefather,   
and where a don can sweetly beg, pop gander,   
green-eyed picker, raven jurisprudence, save   
paradise from them, decent observe away.
