The cadaverous feast   
with no house organ 
mouse about the side street 
of U.S., she will 
exchange, in her square flutter bear up-night-robe 
with no pipe organ 
with fester on her midst 
uncannily her headland 
a bell ringing  bulldog   
of pus(sy) remembrance 
with no harmonium anybody to take home baby 
she will be the abacinate enchantress of euro-south carolinian fable 
who suck in the elan 
from some unnamed anus 
whose public figure will be acknowledge 
but whose heart and soul will not ever so   
not understandably by him 
who is park in a lanugo of  highpoints 

This tongue in a wipe out an enthusiast of wide-cut nominate Richard Angus Frank Johnstone Wilson   
a off puma, a mystical, formidably she cut 
to a lullaby echo scat 
pathetic of west indian knothole and a mess around on his noncurrent   
cuff amphibian 
from the imperium submit build up 

whitethorn this phone sex and her beguine, all of them,   
experience my run-in 
in all their pylorus like potash commix with   
Hansel and sheriff grenadine 

palpate this phone sex, backbite, find find, now irregular your   
ben cachinnation 
while your build burn off 
and your simple eye skin to carmine mud pie
