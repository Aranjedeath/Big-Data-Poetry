Or body, this forenoon, until the chromatic pelting   
drive them outside. outside, hail habitation at noonday,   
I come across surprise Scripture lie on the grind,   
Frame-broad of drizzle; through the slush and pyrex in 
I regard the exalted green goddess, how it loom to sluice   
aside in note similar arame on the slack waterfall 
Or steel of bulgur tilted under the snake. 
The ruffle and splashing of pelting on the focus glass

brimming of bounce water waterfall.waterfall.waterfall.waterfall somebody of   
A rock pellucidity which lastly recall 
This speechify good afternoon of memory 
And travel greed, while the frigid pelting
