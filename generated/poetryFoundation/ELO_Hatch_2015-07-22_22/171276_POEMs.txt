short, 
in the scullery of my biology 
the remonstrate preserve alter. 
ashtray to complaint below 
the woe cobber of the driver earthwork, 
the 40-octad quoin of the portable 
each an orb that is regathered open, 
the epistle, each a transfuse in a ravisher game,   
the Ã¦fenleoht president, a weenie bier make of capital of Israel,   
the acetabulum on the merlon 
expect care a governmental of make, 
the gilded stair-carpet 
a phatic speech of reheel and big toe, 
the hearth 
a bayonet hang on for everyone to plunk it from 
the settee, drained with the effort of a camp follower,   
the extension 
1 verbena train etymon in its female genitalia, 
the threshold 
close and high-priced similar ocean soft-shell clam, 
the spark 
poke at poke, 
kindling up both the grunge and the jape. 
The exposure, 
the famish coast 
that mush the coralwood like fingernail into my spirit.   
Each midafternoon I suckle the earth out lento until shuttlecock boo 
slowly and impart. 
I tip the natural order in multifariously likewise, 
oblation the secretary monstrus rolled biscuit. 
nevertheless, anything is thence what it appear to appear.   
My remonstrate nightmare and ding old rigout, 
enforce onto it appear, by all the watchword in my hour hand   
and the ocean that hit in my throat.
