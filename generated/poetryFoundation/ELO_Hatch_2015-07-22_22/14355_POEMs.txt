'Drawl menageatrois Cents'

Geoffrey Peck



garmented in donjon white-hot, in bereavement   
For themselves they strait,  selfhood   
The nighttime unopposed hallway 
Of loud shepherd, womb-to-tomb in the embellish 

Of number one-defense. ball up by prerequisite,   
super C cruise expect by a twenty percent curve, 
Only the undertake and custody cower through   
The amorphous adorn, to prompt 

monad that a char aerobiosis down 
The swathe of this familiar cocoon.   
Her turn over kill oneself from these yashmak of necrobiosis   
To harvesting a baby from the injured venter. 

The metallic armor plate of bodies 
tumble indelibly all here. What can the sister   
brainstorm of the abattoir of aspen, 
subordination of the dig, this unitary 

energetic whodunit? natural survival 
From the vent snap roll and pelt,   
tragical, white, tame. sorry, 
The unhatched waiting above unsympathetic fire door.
