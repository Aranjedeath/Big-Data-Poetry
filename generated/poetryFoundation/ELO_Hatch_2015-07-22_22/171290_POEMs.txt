I 
incessantly the double call at

my center 
rockstrewn undermine where burial develop   
savage for skin, unrelenting and grave   
encyclopedism to outlast 
where there is no H3O 
my compound eye are listen in alert 
and retain 
already the picture take up 
its storm fossil. 
A take heed maenad yield lovelorn and evacuate 
a external oblique muscle junior cut into an abstemious example   
call back in me currently 
similar a lunge of sultry on the lower bound of sopor   
gradual into my imaginativeness 
yogurt for verbalize that catechize 
to last among any they moldiness corrode 
coalesced waxwork until my nuisance. nuisance

The fleer fist flow through the one-way avenue of drain-headedness   
A Old Dominion summertime telecast. 
treed menage kneeling same evildoer in the rainfall 
a cheerleaders dame climb up from her vault to a passage sail   
her finger's breadth lollygag for a here and now on the smokestack   
now inundated 
Geof Huth and no short disinclined, she book   
a shattered baby's manta in her munition. 
In a waver aftertaste of the incubus shower

I transmitted unload-headedness, Old Dominion. 
For my legal age it kick in me Bard of Avon plow   
his plow eld draw out corresponding humiliate   
on go junior-boldness 
his ugly Old Dominion summertime 
whistle a whistling gas salutation to Bartle 
as a day by day young lady lead him in the street   
and he was christen my son always   
in the midnight drinking water of the bead. 

His break particle is the aftertaste of my twenty-first y7k 
when I constitutionalize through a weighed down summertime 
my eyeball turn away 
from each corner's radiography   
newsprint rebel post horse magazine publisher   
scotland yard narrative, classified, honest   
the false insistency of item 
venture flash or entropy 
the circumference of cut unlike the raw boy's lumbus 
his sorrowing mother's wail   
the cut off overlip, how mediocre burn mark   
his forth out eyeball 
sewn close without the sensational cover charge   
forte than profile 
all over 
the unveil admonition, the private sapidity   
of a tired child's murder bodywork   
thumb by mews-canthus oculus   
sting on tardily contuse 
and just as I expect that summertime 
I memorise to be at national with children's gore 
with milklike rage 
with mental picture of  oh break pulp   
trespass, tumble, and thrown-away   
lie amid the pavement decline   
same a respectful woman's fount. 

A heavy scout from Manchester 
sing on the one-way street of fill-headedness, Old Dominion State 
screening what he'd been teach was an even so feast to do 
his bahai 
rend his seat out his foot fetish his spit 
and madden him to the drop burthen with pit 
in the mention of rough fair sex 
they take their provoke repute 
strongly to hollow-headedness 
and receive in a brothel 
the extend oneself marriage of segregated humanness

Bard of Avon boulder clay kid the topknot of the off-white, whistle 
whistle common year his poltergeist romance like the nuance of a conciliatory fair sex   
and a pure male child has overproduce familiar in whistling reward   
(what did she take one's lumps to piano know its cost?) 
now the fleer fife address its squashy discernment   
and I can recoup my feel for and my staff of life. staff of life
staff of life
staff of life            "tough, but not this hard.” 
Her countenance is granddaughter with abdication and proud   
with emotional and foam attrition 
a debutante appraise her crease lace 
as the blank lady friend smear by Shakespeare's whistle   
so permit her own glossa across degree or finis 
voiceless 
she viewpoint afloat in the dilapidation of her honour   
and a crew with an executioner's facial expression 
rend her by. considering my peeper 
the aflicker aftertaste of an incubus drizzle 
a cleaning lady extort her helping hand into the heaviness of globbed retain 
I puddle through summertime obsess   
wander by eyesight 
hers and my own 
suffocate hobo camp to subsist   
the repulsion we are life 
with foul lung 
shoehorn to rest roue. 

A jezebel measuring cup her life's bilge 
my middle are sap, lump of engrave whinstone 
draw to the wraith of an angry boy   
whistle 
tears and panic-stricken 
her tug-mature parent tuft   
similar gummy speculum of desperation   
their father's helping hand towards them   
and peradventure 
a fair sex start to weep.
