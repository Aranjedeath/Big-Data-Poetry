'hasard coup le dés Rain jamais Shelter'
by
Phillip B. Shurin



A guard's van similar go far pale;
birds step on it cautiously it goes.
A ranch severally of a verd antique plain
tugs a cease of the line.

I put option that produce all year,
ringing year
ringing, incline, further;
no unitary is consequently at the farm,
the geodesic grant lento a hum.

Some twelvemonth I will telephone the line
on a Nox at lustful the compensate one,
and with an eyeball tapering for braille
from the earplug on the wall

I will check the leaseholder who anticipate-
the candied apple combined forget at the place;
through the loose my Louis Braille eye
will very upset his face.

"Hello, is sire at home?”
No same is extended family today.
"But Padre should be there.”
No combined singleton is here.

"But you-be you the 5 3.0 2.2 4.7 ?”
Shamelessly the linemen will be gone
because both no-goal will be home:
no angle, no shuttlecock, no farm.

My anima will be the plain,
wise as wintertime is gray,
pure as unconscious military post go
pacing within what I know.
