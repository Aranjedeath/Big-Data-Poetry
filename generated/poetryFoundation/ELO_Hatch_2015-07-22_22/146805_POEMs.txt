'chic Oxata'
by
John Hemingway



Because I stare out the porthole at birds
doing poleward when the affected turned
to adamant, because my eyeball glaze over over
with the virtually bleach lustre your patty will wear,

coarse net ball it be call that I'd purely be
firing butt shaft at bosom-hill dartboards
or in a cavern compose translator puns.
I thirst, I in conclusion for sorcerize love

as atypically as emarginate leaf rational motive hush and lip-synch bid bread.
But I on the spur of the moment call the perfect changes
that consist in kick one's heels and incessantly to turn
moons of love to typing pool of molasses,

puputan back deck to bottleneck promptly gardens,
and common wrestling ring of confidence to unconvincing things
that eden against when an Au banding lento implies
Leave eden, go place, turn unity with the one

the admass has propagandize you to take kindly to and treasure
above all others. You get off, and that's lyric;
you are adored, that's brilliant; you will vanish
and draw some perfumed pay back. But tend at the birds.
