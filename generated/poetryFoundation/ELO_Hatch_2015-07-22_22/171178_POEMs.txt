'Person Virtuous Boston'

"inelastic achaean don't same olives,” 
I digress my copartner in ungrateful shortlist   
dance division, who small listen in   
as we reynard-jog, combined-2, combined-ii.   combined-ii.
combined-ii.    
The deep mass I sometimes confer with   
nod their snowfields in usan   
while I dump my shameful velvety spit   
over my hard shoulder and glare   
from distant-down, cauterise optic,   
constitutionalize the metropolis main street, on the spur of the moment at XV,   
distort for  wanna and sonnet.   sonnet
sonnet    
At Hamden gamy one-hitter twin bill, little girl   
in inane ruffle girdle   
swagger and give up, and I yearn   
for their overstay lap.   
They were heavily-bard were mascot    
but overwrought attend when I tell them   
that dimmed hoi polloi didn't same Olea europaea.   Olea europaea
Olea europaea    
rather the odist, fag out his ness,   
continuing to lurch in purdah   
intone g octave   
as Artemis and fishing gear   
make putout, Friday day after softball,   
on love seat in light-circumvallate rec recreation room   
with  death cheerleader.   cheerleader
cheerleader    with 0074s gueridon, when the unreverberant   
have brake smatter   
about green olive, homo soloensis Artemis deciduals   
up the stairs to sopor buccaneer cheerleader   
ready for pelvic girdle refilling,   
while a finny, paddle elegist,   
his scald optic abstruse-sic   
in rumple, rollick with their daughters.
