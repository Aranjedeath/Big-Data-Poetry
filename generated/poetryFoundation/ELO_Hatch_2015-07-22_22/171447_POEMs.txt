'Lit Better Contemporary Culture'
by
R. S. Chandieu



If wiseness, as it appear it is,
Be the recuperation of some bliss
From the term of catastrophe-
Terror the scullion, crew the control-
It does not toe the line we should shop 
emergency to leaven ourselves unweak. 
practically of our life, Supreme Being know the score, is erroneousness, 
But who will dally with agitation? 
These befool who could accost threat, 
possessed with being unobsessed; 
amateur of experience
Who have catastrophe to hold off them 
As if dread overseas had remote-controlled them, 
flash a truceless innocence.

I have preferable indifference.
