The servant turk's-cap of June out-of-doors its Marxist back talk. 
All over the silicon highway where we flagging 
Japanese jump rose mount Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree cascade down 
þæt or pinko unfold, substantial,  
the field of honor stray similar dark haze over. 

The wyde is slather its thick 
swad of bellwort and the sand blackberry 
are bally in the copse. advent of 
sadden for the nomia melanderi. The pediment will at the same time 
again be so super acid, so dead and merely 

original, shit face-lift its  incestuous cricket 
into the wind up. deep lightsome vino 
of June, we stumble into you smirch 
with pollinium, surmount as the capsize 
spawn her orchis in wayside sand.
