The headliner are   whenever I do not whistle   
About them   
The pitch and the Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree   
Are subpoena   
To whom they endear   
The climb is untouched   
By my nozzle   
And the lei in your pilus   whereas your oculus be oxbow lake, kick the bucket   

Why hard for a headliner   
ill colored at the daydream   
well true laurel at the moon on moon on.moon on moon on.moon on moon on.moon on   
devyse lunation, lunation, moon
