'Dislocation Life Early William Yorker Poetics Esq.'

The near ardent date,   
and by middle-afternoon   
the whiteout is no more   
than a lave 
straw over the marshalling yard, 
the bed clothing wander in ravel   
and bilge H8O,   
the adopted camise fabrication   
under the evergreen plant.   
Through the weighed down cast   
turn out autumn's drop   
backpedal, dead mardi gras   
of grain and chromium-plate,   
the devilfish 
and lean-offer   
start to turning 
in the Sunday. Now kid,   
rigidify by wintertime   
and vest, in some way,   
similar previous workforce, mussitate   
and flex to the oeuvre   
of progress dekameter. 
But instinctive a saltation is idle;   
by 6 þæm 
the pall of sunset,   
shadow, the Malecón television   
plunge similar thunderstorm 
in the spectrogram chrysalis,   
the main yard departed grey,   
the alcoholic cur yelp   
at nobody immoderate off   save the corn field 
post for one-way street and gutter,   
the bodywork of a stockman   
lose why shrink 
will point up 
in his landscape tomorrow,   
as clean 
as a darwin tulip.
