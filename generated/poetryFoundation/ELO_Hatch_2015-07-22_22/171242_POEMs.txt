any longer elegist, coral-present   
devout marbles 
you have chip in the humanity   
some selection bit, 
gobbet of linguistic process introduce 
as unmatched treat swot up friezes 
and cherry jubilee.   
auf wiedersehen, sayonara, sayonara
sayonara                            I don't scheduled maintenance 
if I decent violent your pure fare plenty,   
electrical buster, illusionist of all hand.   
indulgence, what war crime 
are give in your smear word. 

And you, pleasant woman, bread maker of nasty moolah,   
menorrhea origin donor. Your dirty dog 
drown drown, I couldn't not deprivation 
a sharpen of your roue in origin, it is goose   
by gratifying soft spot, arrant pulsate that positively   
waver: skip town 
to incubus realness. 

It is my big brother, my beguine, 
whose blood spirt out and period 
justly 
because you opt to feel it is not your trade. 

adieu, good-by, 
your haiku 
open their world beak,   
your riverways turn mouldy,   
a disconnection has rent rent
rent                     the chew between rivers, 
and you won't undulate, you're seem 
some other straight and narrow. 
We shan't take on easy-- even you jump jump, farewell   for you the with   
wrestle of your dryness,   
your sick socratic irony, 
your tell, oþþæt,   
wry-humour poised dissenting opinion, 
jump through  
poised? poised.poised.poised.poised cautiously 
how our beaming cleave should ripple and jumble   
for pleasure ...
