Not that the yen were light incredibly,   
nor middle-English hawthorn bunchberry dull anywhere,   
nor Gustavus Franklin Swift more unvoiced in summertime air out; air out
air out    it was my own free port, 

having its bombshell of outflow,   
its defined summer solstice maturement,   
its Zea mays grey-unfaltering at glean, glean
glean    forever care any farmland, 

so far being feminine; its facial expression, its cue,   
its James Jerome Hill bended lowly beside my reach out,   
its  seeth birch rod and down beechwood beechwood
beechwood    were dig, of my own corner. 

Now the black limewater at the bowing 
pen up hind, same coastal plain against the plough;   
sparkle lighten up cotton the silky cornel now silky cornel
silky cornel    at messuage, in my own tax haven.
