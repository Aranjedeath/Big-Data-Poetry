The unfrequented years,    
dankness and dim,    
ocean and sea power a fog.    fog
fog    
And over-embellished murk tusk    
unfold over ebb    
humiliate being accept    accept
accept    
in secretiveness, so agile,    
so out not here, of    
above and except    above
above    
In dig trouble of wakeless    
the live earthly concern become    
incomplete certain nor amid    troll
troll    
The steamy tea bag planter    
was all we penetrate    
of   is  and   is not penetrate.penetrate    penetrate
penetrate    
The shift were concourse    
with open door at the middle    
afford into wedding day    wedding day
wedding day    
wither into Nox    
and the spread out    
speck of heavy.    heavy
heavy    nothing was through with past.    anybody was raise    
make out. Then it was done.
