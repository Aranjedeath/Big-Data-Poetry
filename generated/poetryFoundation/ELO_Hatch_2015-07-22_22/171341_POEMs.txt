In the raw coal seam, in fresh York's spelunk, 
shine foglamp finally slide the stockade,   
carpenter sledgehammer under the small windowpane,   
meander jolt the foreground theater curtain all Nox plenty,   
A swift of tow truck strive acclivitous, cranch,   
Their freightage cover up, as common. 
The overhead buoy up reap, the pitch graph   
slide sometimes away. away
away                            quo warranto the milkman's hash,   
His strive up the step, the bottle's clink,   
I rise from ocean floor, lighted a butt, 
And take the air to the windowpane. The granitelike local road   
model the windlessness in which establish remain firm,   
The street-lamp's watch and the horse's klondike.   
The wintertime sky's saturated stock 
wrench me anywhere to get laid with midrash compound eye. 

foreignness grow in the static broadcast. The unleash   
slick grey. shake patrol wagon, hooves' cataract,   
gong near underneath add, flash and nigher.   
A gondola hack, jackrabbit. forenoon, sometimes   
evaporate the atmosphere, hoist the whole-jacket president   
From underseas, evoke the sounding-pyrex,   
severalize the chichi and the flabby fence.   
The hen misname lento, sing, baptize,   
babble and sing, sing! stuck, small dry   
With sopor, tender, thirsty and hot. hot, hot,   
hot Logos of boy, the illiterate Nox, the lying-in   
Of loose dawn, the secret of start   
Again and just, just
just                         while historical document is unforgiven.
