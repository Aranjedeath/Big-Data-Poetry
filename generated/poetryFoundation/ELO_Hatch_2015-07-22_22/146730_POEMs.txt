'Representative Men'
by
Lady Mary Corral



kind of I square up the cairn terrier 
score the peak 
of same of my filicide, 
involve the bottom lapidate, 
an live care hail over hail, 
muscularity and muscleman same the brook's, 
a ground thrill 
green-mocha blaze. 
before long they will be redundancy, 
and I a crowing towboat of stones.
