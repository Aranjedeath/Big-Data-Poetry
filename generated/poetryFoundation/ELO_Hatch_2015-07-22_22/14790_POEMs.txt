Sept was when it began.
Locusts die in the theatre; our dogs
Silent, be active cotton penumbra on a wall;
And unusual writhe fawn; flare of a kind
We had explode test whoever illume vinery moths;
Badgers and Snake River, abandoning
Their hole out in the allometry; the gourd drown chilly;
Queer radiigera fuscogleba stock; the area and woods
Covered with spiderwebs; gradual vapors
Rising from the blueness  all these,
And more start that tumble. John Jay take flight round
The infirmary in geminate. Where there was water,
We should take heed the ring of tread clothes
All through the nighttime. We would not count
All the abortion, the fall out, the jealousies.
And same evening in a playing area I saw
A drove of Gaul, puff up and awhile,
Hundreds until C, baby-sit on each black,
Huddled macabre, empty, crash,
And try the rattle of look sharp wind.
