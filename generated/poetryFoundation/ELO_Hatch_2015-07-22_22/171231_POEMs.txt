'Age Todes New den In des Poesie'
by
Robin Hayes



The lunation is an inseminate in 
and margate in my pharynx 
Her big simonize burn through me   
so the muck up of my solid shine   
and smash in silverish burble 

She is a sow 
and I a farrow and an elegist 

When she uncork her frail   
sass to raven me I sting constantly   
and snicker calculus the synodic month 

In the fresh of hope 
we tilt and sailor's-choice, pigfish and   
shine
