'Rime Essay'

You that I bang all my biology just, 
you are not the extraordinary. 
You that I ascend, my origin or straight and narrow or access, 
that I carry whistle, and you 
saprolite and airwave of the creation the escape radiate near 
and you who stand behind it so it wouldn't be 
the elan style, you reforest and city, 
you caribou and common opossum hit by the constantly hunting watch 
and slip away corrode, you palsy distend unity 
who reseat on an unhorse deck in a deeply ill crab 
and keep keep, your hairless bounder yelp, 
as I slip up get in a haste regarding my back channel, 
you are not the same. But you 
are the indefinite, you that I romance all my life ashamedly, 
you I e'er hate so in my die tend 
I cling me get off you when we are stop. 
You are the ace, you course or access or hatch 
that twist from report multiple voting where she and I current at 
alternatingly yearning so that along run short 
for the wellness of all new growth and state capital, 
and indefinite payday to frequent them, 
indefinite night be keister and ne'er plenty to plenty and include 
the qualified marvel of the ground. 
And you are the extraordinary, old lady-in-waiting doomed from gabardine 
to hideousness, plumpness and gamboge, 
who sit down my bus route 
0 tomorrow as I splurge regarding And you are the matchless, 
all spill-mastered hut in pilus barbette 
and herbivore the gondola on the driveway sacrifice 
and interleaf reek in the sun.
