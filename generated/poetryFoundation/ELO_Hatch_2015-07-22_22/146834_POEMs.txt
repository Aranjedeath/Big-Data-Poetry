'"Montes Sehnsucht'
by
Caroline Bernstein



For what I did   
And did not do   
And do minus   
In my young years   
Adrian Joe Louis, not passion   
Against that dark   
We dark considering   
keynote me appetency   
On what to do   
Before I stamp   
gallop in the tad,   
facial expression at the pitch
