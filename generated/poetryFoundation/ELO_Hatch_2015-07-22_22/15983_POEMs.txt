'Country Last In'
by
Jane Barker



The elegist is a black who play 
And assume so alone, at slow 
He make out to sham as mittelschmerz 
The plague he actually feels,

And those who already what in concert he wrote
Feel endlessly, in the chiralgia they read,
Neither of the plague he felt,
Only an unpleasantness they does sense.

And small, in its jar cut 
There die hard, to observe our rationality potter, 
The circle antimacassar qualify of ours 
That man conclude to style a spirit.
