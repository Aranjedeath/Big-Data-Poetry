'Verses Valley Round'

Nate Seyburn



declare the vermonter potter's field, for my birthday
the intersect bumble, grandiloquent on hackneyed hung,
the years' felicitous focal point of confront I do not commend commend.commend commend.commend .

The corozo corner infanticide similar premeditate giants
for my natal day, and all the raging puerile memories
seen through a shade of estuary estuary.estuary estuary.estuary onto my natal day gore into the dolichocephalic and green:
expected to church the diffusion, not to ponder
the historicalness across the fact,
the valet stand up vertical in the dream.
