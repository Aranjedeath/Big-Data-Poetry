'To Literature Modern Inland Voyage An Illness Jerusalem'
by
John Taylor



relative majority is altogether. I base on balls in the lunchroom,   
the house, the foodstuff depot; I carousel the cable car 
and catch of Raymond Chandler's secondary dentition and Sudan,   
coin mobile, someone's idly mortified go out,   
tidings of the berliner orthodox jew, the four-hitter test,   
Grandma Moses and whoretalk, spill of peace. I move around   
the varlet of a yard Koran to record 
the announce of Othello Clemence, Halliday, Rembrandt van Rijn, Marie Henri Beyle, André Andre Gide, 
Ouspenski; take notice the relatum: obscurantism,   
factorise, wakeful, rich; fall   
the antediluvian ladder to take heed the snap off destination   
of folk song that ice-cream soda through national capital breath. 
In Osnabrück and Captain Bob, on the Cheerfull winter,   
in Skye, celestial city  haloing (Gopher State), in Father Christmas Fé, 
prompt by zero point, atomic number 81, and gentle wind, somewhere I'm stalk 
by construction of what I construction, lordship, anamnesis, feed, 
the b on the first balcony, the idle, dogs' near back, pianissimo and putrefy. 

relative majority is complete. I commiserate, but does feel for 
too neat for those who tweedledum and tweedledee their  selfhood on their shirtsleeve.   
The pattern's extraordinary I large on a regular basis love; there's extremely no one improper 
with it for all. But I should impart: It doesn't bear for instead,   
before I tug the lift chime and maybe leave.
