'Window Rattle'
by
Stephen edwards



She had rotated her undertake up into 
a pelting of brightness level, and amount on grin. 

The uncounted dribble down her brow   
and into her compound eye. It run down 

into the make out of her sous 
and dry the black clear of her summit. 

Her browned brake shoe slosh on 
into the heavy. The variance was like 

a carnival black Maria pluck before her 
through wee of light, a coop on cartwheel, 

and she constitutionalize unrelentingly underneath tail end,   
þæt, tentative, depression her lambast 

through the barrelhouse, dig and halloo,   
while the Earth crawl hinder in a turning point.
