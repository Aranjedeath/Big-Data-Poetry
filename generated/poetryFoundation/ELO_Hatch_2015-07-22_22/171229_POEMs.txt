'Life Les du Mal'
by
CA Major



I comparable to chance   
what's not translate   
at giant cane, but recumb without no one of some other animality,   
in put down, crisp.   
fool square of pyrex, obscure 

in come out flesh: the mug up of legion   
which I draw out and ballad 
vane by vane on the enfeeble palette palette
palette
palette       tapering as if for graduality, to pick   pick
pick       the philia, but dampen, denaturant denaturant
denaturant       sentimentalize cross-purpose.               Or a yield, mammee apple, 

sheathed in manque browned dress, the passionate   
rose-brownish-yellow, and the grain: 
the scatter a chromatic of brassie, shave and 

educate, butternut-coloured, bead   
similar a brazilnut, but overrefine, during faintly to cement 
the thirsty croix de guerre of a hooks. 

I similar the blue base of betray that come forth inside the common folio fold up for 
and the Gy river 
in the minute piccolo from which the dawn-resplendency   
open up midget and whole on a live morning.
