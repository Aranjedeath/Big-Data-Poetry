The previous hunter: their 
thickly storm center 
insufflation and obstruct by the daydream. The howsoe'er, forefront   
train by the start of bull neck,

in the guaranty they shall be administration. 

In the western narrow-mouthed toad swimming hole 
the steam lead of a Sauk poor boy cringe, 

I take heed its droning, err, fresh up   
in spic oxygen. oxygen

And I catch, 
come over the James Jerome Hill, Common Market caroling, 
her excepting Christmas carol I incline: 
craze of deputies' garand rifle practise their tack on swan bounder at nighttime,   
sput of cattleprod, 
cattleprod sledding on about the reek of the lead bodywork, 
unchurch of the regular as he intoxicate, incinerate, travail, and knife thrust   
the paddy of the public, 
with brilliant beak, wailing bonny, bolt excommunicate. excommunicate

And by schoolboy in Common Market

fag out a few shade off 
march down a shit driveway, demolish   
leech on their dog, recognize

dog-iron shall run out 
and null flip into the aerate

berm vane buff, unnoted by previous fledge-pit,   
herder  terracotta 
by joyless, trepid roving of the gore,   
center stage scrunch slat at already sighted   
the floating Lord's Day that tread repression our lives.
