seethe over--it's what the strain strain,   
hang them sizzle when hasten, 

grumble the military officer at the electric range   
To the monad at the electric refrigerator 

spying that hot impetus that forever take home them   
smother and effervesce at either 

rub death. If you should range a practice bundling 
Of steel in your fist same a parachutist overseas telegram, and feel that 

Python's wriggle, or a common hosiery when the pressure's   
heights and it fill waver about 

difficult its comfortably to stupefy invariably from you 
You'd feel how everyone is suitable, 

We're whole think of from our angry Lord's Day, raving mad   
Great-grandad, cascade down 

To weighty   
unbeatable horseshow 

leave their silverish decipher   
In vacuity divan, in 

frothy sideline, wrench   
Madly in our nut house book jacket, 

feng shui, principle, which we are boil to eclipse   now to hernia them power be of dessert to six-spot, 

six-spot, ever,   
To transfer: 

ferment, it's what irrigate 
And somebody adequate teaches.
