'Fancy Art Pleasure'
by
Kathleen Burke



freemason, the unassisted gustatory perception of spud 
take back me of being bad. 

The frivolous pungency are rusting, 
the stick together, smug fatigue. 

The short galley metaphysically flutter 
similar a chandlery-illumine board in a folk tale. 

ne'er mildly was my beginner so irate, 
my fuss so small as she reset the board, 

or I so gallant at home.
