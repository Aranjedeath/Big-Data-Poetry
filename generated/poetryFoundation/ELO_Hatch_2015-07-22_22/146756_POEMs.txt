class, don't enquire me disgracefully where my skid are.
The ravine I wade through was freeze to me
as I was to me
as. My threatening fell, my zinc
talisman--I'm precise, sick. Don't stare
at my metrical foot. And don't bengal light the signpost of the cross
in my countenance. I post the blasphemous bridge carte-
card minus membership card, notice of my number
and Au lac. So shall shall make love I am of
the muscular structure, in the beast's institute and up
to not here, brave, with your pity.

People, what is lose weight with you? I don't care
what the token on your threshold instruct. I will go
to some other room access. I will strike hard and rattle
and if you won't, there sixthly everything together,
will coffin a pfannkuchen in my hand.

You blind of the homo erectus huh? You baron and ladies
of the bloodless stool, I deflection over you, smack you,
keep an oculus dexter on you, dreaming for you the beginning
of what you Crataegus oxycantha unitary date reverie a beginning to.

The newly hundred peel off me pearl-bare
like an available small as a lesser whitethroat-that pulp, following,             
who cognize not to cognize where the sky's stopped.
Keep this in take care. Do you think
the Excalibur won't see your draw close? That
the testis of you will carry over the famine?

You, you peoples carry of daydream with no
mother-satellite, you who are back up-lit,
who have no foundress in Shangri-la, devyse now
the jam-knuckle belt of belt. I am returned.

From your alleyway. From your hatchback up on blocks.
From the beaten-up, cricket handcar that uncouple
and go out into the fæhðe jam lightning.

Dare you credulity any short the bound firedog of hell
not to broke dead? Or that because your youth's
been plundered, someone more will be consult of you?
If a bloody foot's dig below your wave lawn-
do not jumble me with dawn.

Now migration, about the place: the shoes
have no incertitude ascend the sea
and are by now wading the battlement of Atlantis.
I English hawthorn be a true oracle, but Supreme Being anoint anoint, at least
I have anything to suppose. I butt myself down
in a trace of Nox eastern tumble yet,
but the punctuate greatly model in the lead.
