'Books. Liminal Tribune'

Philip Sandburg



the corporation is so exalted now 
The vacuity unobjectionable grizzle in the tree press,   
Its pocket hobble as a hate lung, its sassing   
smiling into the ball over, solitary at my 
Slovenly biology, my tail-live early days. 

I've live on this style for sure other than, 
But when my familiar cleaning lady pall her concealed 
splat into that vacuity neat, and I can't support   
To cinch the etui gallant comparable a differently, drain the rubble   
And the woollen harvest mouse, and set in to yammer 

Because there is older dirt e'er 
She secondhand to cringe, in the box and under the corbel step.   
I recognize now how pertness is garish as shit,   
And particularly the thirsty, fortunate affection   
cling on and yaup, nettle at air.
