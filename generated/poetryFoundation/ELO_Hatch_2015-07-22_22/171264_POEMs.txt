for union army People)
In the Confederate States of America, bundle against 
the pharmacy, grumble under   
the sound truck and cooking stove, stumble   
through and over the unclutter midstream   
of constructive hereafter day. displeased   
drink wave be active a script or whip.   
square dance kneel catch up taboo, pass   
a manus breath in shade off. crouch   
to deglutition or piss. tension to advance   
root for themselves against horse cavalry above   
where there was ocean (the new anthem   
moderate you to swallow). repose on out   
from this borough, to some other, where   
it is nearly opprobrious. Down a driveway 
where citizenry are awake. unlike   
the synodic month or the dark of home theater.   despite the songs' profess sea.
