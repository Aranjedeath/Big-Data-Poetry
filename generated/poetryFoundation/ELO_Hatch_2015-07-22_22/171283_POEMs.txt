Duppy basil, shad liebe, I had not go for   
to be so wroth wroth
wroth
wroth                   The day snake tincture   
similar the hushed halitus of the humans 
in a regular recurrence toward ego, gearwost and beat out   
as if to shipwreck puschamber, dinge our impecuniousness   
and all the land's benumb and Amytal and intimate 
under mangle bamboozle bamboozle
bamboozle
bamboozle                        the tag quantum leap in the steer   
yelp, unbalance with wintertime, and his accompaniment   
exactly dourly and intensely down the nullah   
corresponding pine-tar rag of halfhearted waft waft
waft                                                         birch rod 
shout and carolina hemlock by the brooklet 
yield hunch over and toxicant with their contractor   
in their hip pocket 

Duppy common basil, the man is passionate   
and via cross-purpose cross-purpose
cross-purpose
cross-purpose                               how right 
this power be from the Nox of autonomy night   
if it were not for you.

It is an interrogate short 
of the corner with our asterisk and unfrequented 
of your aureole fetch from the shore   
where fable blossom to this soil   
but more than these our factor of proportionality wealth   
is a chalet in the whistle and an unhorse   
on the raft 

Duppy sweet basil, our heavy rekindle 
in this far cry from the gesælde down, 
in this disconsolate of the iron heel-mark river where sedately   
the snake shell shell
shell      is what we are for the life sentence that we are   life sentence
life sentence      what we anticipate for the future that we lie with 

How slenderly and blase the deliberate touch in the dark.
