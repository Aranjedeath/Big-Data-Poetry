Philip Barot



When all my 6 and wold common sense escort, 
The index will draw a blank uneven echinus and bar sinister   
How, through the halfmoon's cast out center stage,   
shell of valuable headliner and potent zodiac, 
romance in the rime is flay and overwinter between 
The shout spike will wake have it off beat in reality   
Down doddle and cuticle to an unknowledgeable plage,   
And, whip to ultima, the bobcat spit yell   
That her affectionate maim are vamp piercingly.   
My anterior naris get word her hint suntan similar a chanar. 

My unrivalled and rhyme philia has character witness 
In all love's swiss, that will goo girl asleep; 
And when 3-dimensional quietus slump on the undercover work sense of direction,   
The spirit is open, now when 0 eyeball hairline fracture.
