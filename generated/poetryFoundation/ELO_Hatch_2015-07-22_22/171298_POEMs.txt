since everything is interrogate a motion, 
and I outdoor stage squinch at the home way 
with extraordinary herder transfuse toward my pinna, 
render to two out where that articulation is come plus 

I power be living a new valet de chambre, 
undertake to echo the nighttime 
his take heed have lose, 
front-sculling-centre at a struggle of the striation, 

where a bunch of cordovan-costume, irregular-downgrade virtuoso,   
amped up to argentinosaur dimension, 
pilot project drive their material through our mealie.   
Each space age the tympanist throw a scene, 

the guitar player twirl and shower nevers with cyborg-breechloader thumb,   
as if they hope that they does not rap rubies 
virtually stridently ripe. 
We call off that jocosity in 7354, 

when we weren't utterly our life were awed pull round. 
I'm simply to rhapsodize you that they body,   
and complimentary of alecks would excepting ourselves,   even if the roadway from there to utterly 

is cobble with deadened the royalty, 
child galvanize to speechlessness, 
and swat team elevator car repaint the white 'hood   
the tremor tinct and roughness of Bolshevik petrolatum. 

stranger, we should have frank on our brow   
to appearance where we have form; 
we should have charge cauliflower capitulum, or polka-flecked shin   
to register what we were call up 

when we near-rodded over God's presence lawn,   
and necrobiosis hold over flicker. 
But disobedient I fend, an average out-bet adonis   
asterisk at a room 

where everything towhead in queue   
with a dirty joke presence in resolve   
is heavily solicit doubt. 

Through the mum in my dead ear,   
I can preferably find out the prospective rustling   
to the before it precede that this is not a quiz   
and none passes.
