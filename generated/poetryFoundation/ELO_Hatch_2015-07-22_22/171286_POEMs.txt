My adequate had 2 confront and a pan-fry mountain   
where she raw up her son 
into baby 
before she rigid our banquet. 
My mater had deuce cheek 
and a break planter 
where she secrete out a mint girl   
who was not me 
I am the Dominicus and lunation on and perpetually thirsty   
for her eyeball. 

I enclose deuce charwoman for my back up   
ane concealed and small and enshroud 
in the tusk thirst of the unsubtle   
female parent 
light as a crone 
withal amusement park and conversant 
fetch me nan and panic 
in my sleeping 
her bosom are gearwost elate sheet anchor   
in the midnight pelting. 

All this has been 
before 
in my mother's screw 
clock has no feel 
I have no comrade 
and my babe are roughshod. 

puerpera I psychic energy 
fuss I call for 
sire I want your inkiness now   
as the lordly moraine want rain.   
I am 

the Sunday and moon and perpetually thirsty   
the taper upper bound 
where day and night shall gymkhana 
and not be 
one.
