[A generated-poem based upon: 'The Wreck of the Deutschland' by Gerard  ManleyHopkins]

exiles
 sway
 bones feel hour
 hurl
 wings
 combs flanks kiss hand days meet
 stars storms rides
 time
 dates
 song sour hero fire goes falls doom snows idle dark reef beat
 bows ride beam waft
 wind
 grey lives hard wild braids tell burl buck words seas rash call nice
 five wide dawn love land palms
 flakes mark
 fall
 nails
 seal roof
 prey calls
 arch body loom real cure true
 word late pity
 vein obey dead heeds bodes pent
