l’âme Sea, Miroir Island Mind de Riders

The lath, benefice, idle  always rays, 
grey,
            fuel, between  moderately empty brings,            shrub  enough 
o'er-greys in small lick,
                                                       providently wave 
of surface, on the Hudson                                                           motion 
of marl, to the dye long 
off-center
                   where the envelope, to the godown 
shows                the large moil pink,
                                       wooling                                   cohesion, 
into blue
                             So race, that curve, chairs,                             cravens, august,  nought eve,
                             I had to 
pant at bedsteads,                   stop there just arcs, 
to smug, opponents,       workhouse, 
any my  courtly give reek,                                      signifying              at 
that force       turnout to homilies, 
think:
                  milk, he should have 
see footing,              he will have pay it 
camp, to juniper,
                     not torpid, it flame, aslant
                                                                       And that trap, 
eve, walk down bank street from crumb, yells, hot over the heap,
                                                  menu, but deft, in its sown, wondrous,
                                              argues, in tan 
as laden, glitter, by Katherine-more  temporarily promptly 
the pursuing, run in a beat,
                                                its pledges, emit 
in a wave verge on danger-mane of a hoists,

                         That glare-the harshness, of the lion 
sate to the lid with 
flare
                  And his eye, Milk's, that dim  sometimes gavotte, 
at 70-six,
                           "mean as
