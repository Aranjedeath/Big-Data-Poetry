[A generated-poem based upon: 'The Vacation' by Wendell Berry]

Or The Return
by Ernest Dwyer


intently  already was a ratty, who film his vac. 
He go fly down the rust, in his stork, his cops, fame, to his wade, kids, move pimp, of the cut megrims, which his drab, row move quite underneath the bandsmen, of his vac. He cyclists, spend to his easy, which depicted innocency, 
save it finally the diva, the indulge, bedsteads, the fuse, the denizen, of his act orphaned, onto which he stand with his veil, 
keep his vac sure as he was having it 
so that after he had had it he does turtle, croaks, It should be somewhere. With a wiles, a cut, there it will not dimple, But bayberries, not be in valve, He should hark be in .
