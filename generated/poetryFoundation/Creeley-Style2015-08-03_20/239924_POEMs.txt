[A generated-poem based upon: 'The Angel with the Broken Wing' by Dana Gioia]

Times Irish Sun, The Blood
by David Snyder-Camp


I am the whet, with the break manure, petrel, box herm in this tie tired, tire, find me too adverb, and so they shut
hawk's elan in this air-qualify conditions, shirk, rave my twit, venom, the talk of the national, I am a work of sort-
The hone dove of covers, hew me for a land jeer, name's slip now below by moth, wash unmix'd a humanity, claw, horizontal, tidy, offer rapt, their verticals, hear their char noise at my foot-
Prayers for the lose, the die, and the mavis, cd extended my trace up the cuddle, I root the ache that they staggers, break my  little pasty, in the skill, a maps, can warm, oysters, oars, were entries, to key the uphill, quay, me rather-already function, aims, the ogle,  always anyone in a pumpkins, pain of  habitually care? Who know what it recipes, shaky ectoplasm, by their tastebuds, hen store they can't dismiss.

There are so remember, part I  listen  really gleam, howl of the dam can't herd, so vowel, I ruff,  wherever an elves, pill peg to a latkes, halt saint against a fart, .
