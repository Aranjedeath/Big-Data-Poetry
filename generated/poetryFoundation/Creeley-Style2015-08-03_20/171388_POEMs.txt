[A generated-poem based upon: 'Burning' by Galway Kinnell]

Voice Stella Obra
by John Wilmot, Earl of Haag


He life, who fling, dark flop from an ordain,   
Into the brook, and all soot, by a cops,   cords, pin to the pimp, sexy as a bumps,   
But for the parenthesis, of the gradual, of his gloss, 

I bring him boil mesas, and soup.   
He hack and curl his neck 
And cysts, up say he wouldn't mascot,  simply   
Being ting, itself after that  exaggerated 

I searches, save in the soggy, with the spayed,   
tiring a stock on the ail  driver   
In teras crutch, he hobble laurel,   
And come the stamen, in ewes, be. 

He tell the aura hunt, his savior,   
Its cook, was diver, and it live, 
Not cheat by the Creek at logo,; 
If all his crushes, abroad, drown he will not be  plainly 

He lick its glads, and end in the  somewhere   
And come out with a gem gavel in his ninth,   
And lift that Green bob of lobster, roundel,   
And buys, it maps, on inexpiable, of the dog's  gingerly 

I haul off the body, hinds, it  sometimes 
Then he come too with what a winy, to lechery,   
Or sideburns, on a dog's shut, his sardine,   
And pour it out and go inside to rest. 

I amethystine, him awake in the dot of agua,   
looking unselective, at acid, simply the code,   
blind the ice-already a lumbar, match   
burn a sign burn in the Wilderness.
