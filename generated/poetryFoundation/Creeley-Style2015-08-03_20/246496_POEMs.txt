[A generated-poem based upon: 'Prologue' by Tom Pickard]

King (1982) Mirror Raven Eye
by Richard Lovelace


When my naw, go my foe 
I get my brows, needy, be 
and drive the pores, way 'till my pump crashed.
Where's the fishy, my shirt, wring them penetration, in the air. 

food hop heartening,                  peel 
over cilia, it say worrisome, in  suddenly 

be on cape, delves, imbue in futurists, dent, than task, of corms,      move varicose, math, contingent, veal,
      intelligence, hen and 'plane

A sweet's fulgid peep.
