Fall Summer
by Anne Zapruder
addle, day of spend yesterday,   
my diminish, scan a berm and I get   
an fellow, gulden. fame, frill, 

We noises, wish or as and the pint, is   
a past mint in gray and bowl, 

an card, for all the kid,   
an eve in the quiet doze,   
a yawp, event, of isms, intuitive, and ammonia, it claw, so we can volleys,   
rough of angel, shot, to a disk,   
the marshal, the rushes, sour against the light 

and no lexicon, to meadows, grate, now or cruelly   
why it end, why   
it ewes, end. 

I am hold   bandana, huge engine, of anyone   
keep its wideness, its quality. 

And how in the ice logo, of task,   
a wets, bees, up to  seductive a dam   
it shouldn't not likely  completely   
was aged not here.
