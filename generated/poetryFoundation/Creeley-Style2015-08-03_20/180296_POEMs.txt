[A generated-poem based upon: '[From behind, standing, from a distance]' by Geoffrey Brock]

La Llaman Books, Look
by Brian Altmann


From following seated, from a leg, 
in pass, the smash, chin, run, 
I'd null, halfway, I'd see her  quiet 
and what wouldn't I ? My chum, house, 
buzz, won't dusk, my pauses, stage vowels, chintz, pages, 
ill to lead as comparably as the  ocean begin.
