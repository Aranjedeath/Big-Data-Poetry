[A generated-poem based upon: 'December 26' by Kenn Nesbitt]

Latino Paris
by Hoa Wilner


A crushing, snapper, 
A wood, flat. 
A ball. 
A 'lectric chin, 
A bike. 
A rust, pyrite, 
A drawls,  inspected 
A ball tames, 
A be of card. 
A nose smear, 
A place tax. 
A catcher's  little 
So that's my lunar, 
of anyone 
that the pals, 
bury to bash,
