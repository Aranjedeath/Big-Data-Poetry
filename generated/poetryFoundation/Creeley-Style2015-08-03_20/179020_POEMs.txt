[A generated-poem based upon: 'Sonnet' by James WeldonJohnson]

Full. Nation Empty
by Cleopatra Lee


My digger, be wise, and do not move orchestration,   
Nor alee, more that growl, hope cry.   cacophony, extract, is gals,  shrewdly and land I  sometimes   
But do not complement, dispose, sore, and heart go;   
For sure as the raven-fast day 
Is play by the grabby and blushful  is   wrestle, come day will be tows, and deep;   
'Tis upsets, when the mane, is veil, wear.   
look versus and baptized, from ebb cloud,   
And do not in fats, own pure dark nawashi,   
rise beyond and molding off deep, dark hide,   
mold M to prism, and late shod,  little drifting,   Tho' dote, the duel and tho' rough the war, lunar,   There is a film, make for the echo,
