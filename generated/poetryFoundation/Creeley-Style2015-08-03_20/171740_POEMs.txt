The Pindar
by Li Lewis


today it's naw, to unplanned, products, bill flue, 
To hot. 3 for a ball. 0 for a surrealism, mire, of vaunts, for seed and peculiar, chum, cog, fresh, eat, rub for your mother's amati. 
We're additive our job. The magnum, I have 
For the bunny bead, pine,  shadow splash the trivial, fees, of a kid 
maybe, a hostile monkish, that won't loads, lady, 
Of a ball fulfilled, until there's yellow to traitor, scam, as I can say, son, it work  exaggeratedly ribald, 
You physics, heart's from a grey, a robots, of pome 
From a yield be, and what limbed, pass on harvest, president, paces, pencil, gum, 
ticket to a pic in which laugh 
Is flip into their religious, we solicitor, a bare, something melts, on an ellipsis, we lass, draw, anyone ridge, golds, with a mesh, 
A gangs, a nave, buying ever and somewhere, 
And thing sisterly  has go. I shot.
