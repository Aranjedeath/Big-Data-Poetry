Fall Errata
by Brandon Moxley


It's not here the wood, 
of the cane, but his heart: 
with its null, wing, pure lap, 
USAF, hip, groom, from rues, riding, 
This expiations, grin see lip. 
look this deliberations, 
it's not a bald, kennels, 

It's not  always the raver 
who combination,  probably a craw, pet 
as because to children's thin-No 
it's the gal in the swing's cycle, 
the tick of the tows, at claw, 
the tidy, of the dommes, the mane, 
of the  somewhere order to the be. 
The zoophilia that routs, 
the baby is an eye look 
into his emit, 

It's not  little the Village snug, 
with its piper and immoral face 
that cut the change-no 
because if it be, party 
with amati, harp, attempt, does not have agree the ask: atones, it is the rise and lift, 
the fail and catch of 
that snap, wets, of mass, 
before it crash, that be.
