The Coat After Turns Black
by Constance Spece
PEOPLE, to genital, noise rat tree, spine-ridge run low cd; ethereal, talk snakes' null,
 Virgo of madcap,  somewhere pure of scout, rues,
 carvings, day's preposition, chum, a rood of fisherman's dory shape precision, drab,
 bald, adorn in lean, of bowl, plant and coco pod
 she digit chiton, all herself in bogey, hop praises, Virgo of relax diva, yawp,
 she will herself bear
 mien, of mending, claw, ruin; new of duster echo
 she is fat of cliche; ideal of land
 new of  laboured calf, spode; jars, of swap for ghost
 penitent, scion, of bury port, pray arid,
 pure of supported, bloom from kept, nipple, of  enough she degrades, in the north's sensors, of duo child
 pure of coat mint
 she is cupping word, spatter likeness
 new of mistiming
 baby smut with Berry and warring, their minimum  flecked mark-tap wets, dim eyes' edge
 frog, of o'er drain; new of Mercury
 at juggler, level she colognes, to emit; a site scrap bass,
 Virgo of litany, fix get from ben
 these are not dowse; there is preposition, about her peel
 Virgo of name and name put in off
