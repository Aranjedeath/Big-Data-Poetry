Hymn Life Cahier natal pays retour Au
by Medbh Steensen


spend brant, redtail
I'd rigged, these aegis, 
huddle  always paints, the dig peel, sprawl of their tire, 
look for the classmates, rapt baby 
bunch against the roll 
rise for decrepitude, swings, slow to intrude, 
and the small, 
a self, of a snook, 
robe in a pitch, 
grin and bet 
his flamingo, ramp,  simply 
the doze, 
wad with genius, 
aim at my look.
