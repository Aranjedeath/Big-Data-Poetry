[A generated-poem based upon: 'Wash of Cold River' by H. D.]

20th Poetry Music: Song Facing Irish
by Oscar Spagnuolo


wash of promise, drive 
in a prices,  dexterously 
atom, dims, 
chin, Snow-ribbed  enough 
crop of raw peak, 
o'er, with magician, husk  already widening, cup 
freeze lily-leaf 
shrub buzz, 
cold than a wax; 

wind-bud 
that keep the sore, 
of the N-nose 
these and no one mob;  ignominious thought and  continually 
move out to deal 
the wealth of my  slowly  forward hand and olive, 
draw shore, and  little 
all the bold bliss 
that I could fill 
to mold a lyres, 
and  straight herm;  barefoot of aunts, nap, between loon, and  probably 
gore to bray, 
your saber, left,
