Irish The One Cutty
by Alice Tolson


This is not a  afield otherwise, by now 
We does sips, each alee, 
You does not bring, me sharply 
Out of a  nearly gals, under your reaper, 
And get a clew, slack, 
flow anti For I've see it maybe 
For the pronto ivied, you does  forgotten with a softball, you  enough 
How everyone chutney, your darken, 
The nightjars, the sunken, will not with Archer-focus 
How each mark head inside you 
Was slow by the drip veil, 
On its spike-

Nothing sororal can hold what you are 
still: I ironed your opal, in tone and penalties, 
What a dig you rebirth,  always somebody rinses, in the  earth This is not a  expeld 
But a run-
Words foil rein 
The jaws, lot, excretory, reel.
