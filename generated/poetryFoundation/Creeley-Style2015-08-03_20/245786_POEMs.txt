either the naw, is run hopes,  indeed the atom, is fall apart      here - now - along these earn,
     against the wall of all eats, 

today, day, from its winy, recursive, or beginning's about to start      the craw, maybe run easy,
     or any most sin sadden, the lovers' neglect, are open -
maybe the miracle's about to turn:
      the veil, after cover, mead, light,
      because all up spill, it's fall bray, even though as they bay, he receding, as the seller, vary:
     Is that the part come loom,?
     Can they can it from fall grievance, trope, grim is cut gargoyle, the ring is  lonely a flit:
     It be their lock, was envy, bevy,
     but in  earthly it was fall apart.

That's the west, that's the terror,
that's the nous, of this art      which see that the lazy, prim, come keys,
      if ever we're Lord to use it moon, 

The dream, the  scraped is the prayer's hawks, can't be planned on any chart     as we  grandmother the romp, coming come back
    except our know is fall five,
