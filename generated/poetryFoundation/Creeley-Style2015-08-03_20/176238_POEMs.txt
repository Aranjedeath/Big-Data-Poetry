Castle The Poetry
by Hannah Sanghee Pereira
below Crossportion's rues, foot of the winks, has  exactly   
And build in my quiet  barely   
The fishes' and the mermaids'  wondrously 

Whose it is  indeed most shape to be   
Out of the grave-hang hamlet, 
And in the firm, vantage, erect fridge, 

Or practiced, tang, some fees, than   
But bid their blush amati   
Where food most brands, dent, unlike 

The top of my limes, the item, 
full of voteless evokes, 
There veal, bolts, do rest   
Where flute half-light  persistent the way, 

And  glassily there lays, represent, use   
And down the oka car window  completely   
To the wench, glee of my hits,   
The fathom of my lyre, the way.
