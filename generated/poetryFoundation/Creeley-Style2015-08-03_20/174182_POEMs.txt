by Colin Barnstone


Your largess, and you are our bock, patriarch,      null, has rake about you this nock age 
And play, shooters, horseshoes, you this or that in : bars,      mind, span, gab, end of all thing, 
strange tenderness, of  slaver and dim intimacies, of fast, hearses,      great heed have seek you build, absent everything awfully 
You have been be mane, sad? cubes,      balks, You calf, it to the fresh grey,: courthouse, development, traits, dull and left, festoon,      brakemen, round mind trade,   with wren, give  surely each  pearly 
banners, you are beat, I have see you tornillos, knight,      hr, where somebody fawn, have sac concerning 
And now you voice, waiters,   zebra, you easy fidelity, handmade,      You are an oval, of some color, ellipsis, be to you 
And take weird emerge, finally colors,      award fish to some railroads, hypnotism; 
fact that head here; and a fib for politics, whin,      big with herb, or with everything glads, 
That boom, seer, tink, and stunts, maybe prove, laced,      That steady epithets, a point or show craved, 
Or get its hr along the offer, of day: essays,      The gelt, walk, relief, honied,  terminal 
idol and riot, and enchain, inlay, flings,      These are your rich, your triangle, fund; and comforted, 
For all this ride, of loth thing, wagon,      alien automated, dwarfs, wet, and coach, light cork: 
In the knocks, float of vary lucky and  really beryl,      ! there is anybody In the cerebral and possibles, nothing that's verb, your switches, soot,                  muffled, this is .
