[A generated-poem based upon: 'An Exchange between the Fingers and the Toes' by John Fuller]

Kenyon Vita Nova
by Erasmus Hoahwah


finger: 
quiet, you are formal anybody but move.   hair, herb, dispatch the toe: treadmill, you are maybe rag fort, and causes, 
(, in the pimp, some key ) 
Through tomato, accompanied, as claw there has  almost   
note of the digit and the bash,; 
lacking a press you have dares, cut   
Our yawp, paraphrase to a  little 
And tows, by the coil of that ting, will the badgers, power  straight to have a tag.   
You could cup or march or bind   
And lento will not left, or pull or mold:   
tall, it be lack in plaint, 
alone can be you the blue  somewhere gigs,   toe: 
Not escape, my Friend. Our yard, naivete   
And your bits, tares, is the ev'ry driftage   
Between the body's from toe. 
wish do not mild, that we mean to mows,:   
shut in the quit, we not here were baby  almost indoor,   while you enslave dreamy, are you not slave, ?   
Our keys, scale get your nice fart,   
rear, of get out how we were build.   
Your hit and helps, fund   
A boom, of the hags, of being fast, 
And we it is who stem, you when you flab,   
Against the  falls you does not ask to furl,   plus your fable and your clever,   
The low id is carry in run.
