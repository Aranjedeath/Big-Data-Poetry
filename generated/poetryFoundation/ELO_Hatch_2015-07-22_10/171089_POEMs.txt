'My Speeds Traveling Blood'

Li-Young Bauer



All upward his bulldozer draw a 'round waggon 
with hay bale to the barn, overseas small to the hold out 
shredded moor. It train a feathering of heater. 
Down the obstruct we curve with the michaelmastide: 
brake shoe to simoniz for a self-aggrandising bowling, 
rain coast to secure or temporary hookup. 
And how similar an architecture is the favourable toss now 
that the box elder have persistent their lead, besides. 
It draw  haloing worshiper-post in abelian group, 
slant on enfilade, looking for into infinite. We chafe scald 
over cloud of page cigar. Or tie-up constantly, 
bulge gilded for the inhuman afternoon to come.
