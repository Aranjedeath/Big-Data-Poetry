A ugly moshav in Nutmeg State has mixed-up its imbecile.   subtitle on a declaim polarity polaritypolarity   have skull pyramid rightly.   Edgar masquerade as poor people John Jay, from brown.'s bladder; stooge stooge, outtake outtake 
But if oh where is the beautiful mongoloid, 
tautology vote counter and astrologer, herculean 

of inspirit, fink feeder, riverways spider 
whose usual and reverberant close rich and mad, 

bough and put up, with veneration and veneration? 
Is he conceal in the quarry of the walkie-talking picture, 

its brightly of muddle so atremble, 
simply please a coddle, suckle in the constabulary sergeant's 

lightly vocalise as he yelling in reenforcement? 
paradox so mongoloid, is that you sniffle the trice 

for the quick poop bouquet on the affixed motorcycle cop 
advance their horses' vibration, real 

haunch into the demonstrators' present? 
psalm absolutely moshav since the kraal, 

the barren old boy, the forever bedlamite is hold out, 
and no one provided live where to incur him...

Lying in bleaching clay? rest coat in slop, pilus halves into burl? 
Some audible harebrained new world jay wandering the heather 

for a cool subdued rate to lie his torso about 
his voice communication taken up with bayat, devil, 

his spit telephone forward the cruddy ogre, Hudson River 
as the stepper heavenly mortal, scratchy into the push 

and he eat out foulness, he chock up his varmint babble with skank 
and thoughtlessly he sit around on his fecal matter in the treadle timothy 

and profound-furrow mud pie, he inunct himself 
with white ash and clay, he call option on his cap 

of mermaid stub and apply his sceptre 
of a smoldering fire hook and see the cloister to order.
