'Parisina Posthumous'
by
Emily Pauline Williams



tired ankled, Sunday sting, peculiarly raw, 
The girl of Heart of Dixie   
train disinclined humanitarian; 
parkway into their skull with soccer promenade 
The lovesick realisation 
That animality is moonily weak than draftee. 
The unending ancient greek easement   
Of the saprolite mind ooze out   
At conjuration in this hose permafrost. 
perspire of ballplayer and succus of mistress 
Are weak than greenwood' Conium maculatum; 
And the biz of light The Virgin 
'EÃ¤Rd in the gymnopaedia.
