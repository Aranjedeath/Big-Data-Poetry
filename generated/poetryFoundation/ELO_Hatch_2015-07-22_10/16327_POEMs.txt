stay on
stay on
stay on       That ocean we wise up of floor
   ridge small on a regular basis does be some other world:
A osseous tissue saddlery, sop in dewdrop, an underprice-
Ground for oddment, the ocean-yap goose
   approximative scraps papist city cast
       offshore osseus towards our coalface.

       That ocean will not crop up private overproduce,
   grey-necrose by itself, incrust thick
With happy gold, the spoil
Of hearing-sourdine swim, the exuviate
   live, buoy in a stack-emerald theology
       Of conical buoy-please implant wave short sleeve.

       That ocean will not twist plus look
   In its large exclude, long from its song,
The exalted, obscure crisphead lettuce, wretched, white
With gravidity since fiddling up its crest   similar ourselves in the flush-beasted triumph,
       get in an evenhandedly XTC.

       In the mathematic bonanza, all stop bury
   Articulation's drift net, whose ribbon-bones
(A glædman pluck from toss to heel)
Hang in the past that drop from the creel
   count from the underweight paw that possess
       All shark net and all fishing reel off.

       His rescript cover a break interrogate:
   The thumbnail of squama a Hydra will shed
In take shape, volute after spiral, on wash clay,
Though away to the snake squirm surely,
Are but telefax, as before not whatsoever all in.
       screen this, perceive how the kneel eschew

       run teetotal gravestone to that wash
   That strip mine our standpoint in the Garden,
Whose edge inkle guide in the sun
To fathom all innocent skip distance of Shangri-la.
   world is an angelical that require a warden
       To scare off the Master's take the bull by the horns,

       For emphatically an idiot scan an academia
   No stemma or tree cannot stargaze for encounter a name
For chiralgia or cut of cut, friezes female
Of nonpareil manner of some other. In his orchard,
   asleep chokecherry Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and rampantly venison
       vegetate heedlessly, though he Trygve Lie curling,

       The tongue and double of our want,
   smoke a tube, with a sparkler-hot Cola
Clutched in unitary bidder, and the blessing unequals spread
On both his stifle. He'll exit his prowl hit the sack
   To outstroke blistering idle words on an older Victrola       A Former Armed Forces watchword from the sensual Pisces

       Whose thin-boneless spur our support review:
   The river merchantman, and the ocean-silt up soft
As borsch, the moolit where nighttime lackey came,
Tempted by the lake crown to pall the cripple
   columniation, go through the motions of the get on an attic
       accommodate to our abbreviated nonmember,

       And out we shin, eyeball manor,
   Our dampish centre focussed on the moron green,
Hot on our game læssan dispassion, shadow
Forming in the seanets, sea wrack into hayfield,
   at long last bring at the infantry of ache,
       enceinte with piquant smuggled

       While the birdie prodigally outfox blue air
   On set up forewing, as mayhap they soared,
Feathered and rich, from short cladogram to stake
A allegation so beautiful that now we underwrite
   To plat a pressure point we truly know,
       abreact expatriation from that untruthful side,

        upon mime of the true's Holy Scripture,
   Our prohibitionist interlingual rendition make from the deep,
Bespeak its past linguistic process. The salt
Our bout and rip essential harbour from its overleap
   Is spill on all plage-headland where we crawling,
       tear tile, dry crab, and winged bird.
