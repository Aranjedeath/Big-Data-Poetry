'Sorties Robinson Domesticity'
by
Anne Novey



That occasion my grannie trail me 
through the aroma gangway at paradise, she defend me up   
by my dolman sleeve, hushing, "stomach up,‚Äù 
through guerrilla tooth, her eyeball 
mediocre as a dog's 
at bay in the visible radiation. 
She say it over and minus 
as if she were Madonna, 
and I were stagnant. She had been 
buster as a stemma, 
a seal above her neckline, a 
light-skinless matron whose gondola was angle-park, who parade on whirl 
kind and legislate through 
face curtain raising 6730. 
There was not lightly an unlike 
lift supermarketer at promised land. 
The salesgirl had land velvety   
chap to lace up me beyond and coo, 
as if in the serve of all grandma.   
My grannie had dimple, but not   
surely, not cotton my supermom 
who bonnet them, but hanker to enchant,   
and they had grin perchance, as if 
they were bear awkward shoe collar.   
When my shank's mare yield exterior, my nan   
hang back me up and carry me similar greek deity   
bear patron saint by the 
rootle of the pilus. I schnorr her 
to trust I couldn't serve serve. bumble,   
her present segregated 
with fret, she promote me through the troop, hasten 
buckeroo from those centre   
that autopsy through   
her robe, under 
her scrape, all the form down   
to the crystalline   
proto-oncogene confessing.
