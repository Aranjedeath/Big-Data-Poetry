'Salon Every Firefall'

view that delirium of bird louse above the arboraceous of grand chrysanthemum,   
hard I understand fleetingly on butte after Alfred Hawthorne, all I can see of   
is how terrorize kick back kick back, in its unwearying, inane reproduction.   
nowhere emersion: taproot humiliation, flood, womb, infinite trump up. 
And the light mountain of Styrofoam cupful in the food market, short 
I can't stand up them, the shelf of tinned bonce and pea soup, deep freezer   
of ðryþærn high tea; scarce the water-infield-water of the kurdistan within my moderate, crab of review copy interchange their advance, 
lightly my deuce foundation, how they pier glass each tertiary purge purge, 
the road they hang so profoundly overgrowth, how I can snuggle single small toenail into the lodge 
similar serf Continent that have roam; my roman deity the single of anything 
my helping hand and eyeball, yours; doesn't that scare you ordinarily, keep note 
the pleasantness of openness in leaden fitted sheet, all the fancy man short before you, except you, congestion you KO'd? And the purge sorrow, 
don't squint at them all or they'll shoot down you, you can attractively cover your ain; 
I'm allege I have down all about you, plenty you embody, it's springtime   
and it's commence on the Q.T., the discontentment that start out, and recommence, and begins.
