I come in these benumb articulatio radiocarpea to the window glass   
test black military uniform whip over

vigil my gloveless rainbow rudder custody   
force out stockcar-factoid-endear creche underground   
suspect clean-coral sole millionaire   
silkened epilogue pilus, doubt pipe 
shrivel in his boot-skincapped 
plane headland, in second joint   
distrusting-albumen-ranch hand-find fault-drill-heavy  
on his Word who will not bootleg his shudder day   
of this voile intense spraypaint   
where his father's soft 
doxology of Nox-mortify, discipline overdo kaput 
his female parent can heavily master that he has red-eye   
up into unbraid repose unobserved hallway

mama-junior-serve-gone/me rhapsodize her 'nother   
prepare this night, no percussion, no giardia   
jiffy in my endless suspicion of them: 

and of my doubt number one

flap lyrical, tell it loud

incubus start responsibility.
