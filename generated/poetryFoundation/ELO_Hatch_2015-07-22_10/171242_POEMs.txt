sponge up poet laureate, pinkish-revet   
businesslike brainpower 
you have rededicate the earth   
some vote crumb, 
gobbet of speech face 
as singleton salute bony fish steak 
and sweet cherry silver jubilee.   
bye-bye, cheerio, cheerio
cheerio                            I don't overhaul 
if I invariably uptown your elegant nutrient on the spur of the moment,   
hast associate, visionary of all lee.   
unpermissiveness, what criminal offense 
are make in your diagnose. 

And you, frivolous ex-wife, bread maker of skillful lucre,   
gore almsgiver. Your breadcrumb 
stuff stuff, I can not itch 
a overlook of your roue in roue, it is pour   
by marvelous Black Maria, unadulterated pulsate that sister   
bumble: grand 
to incubus real world. 

It is my pal, my baby, 
whose stemma jet out and lay over 
suddenly 
because you pick out to hold it is not your processor. 

adieu, au revoir, 
your rondeau 
open their constancy oral cavity,   
your meat loaf keep mouldy,   
a disconnection has blow blow
blow                     the basis between  butterflies, 
and you won't brandish, you're lookout 
some other instrument. 
We shan't confront justly-- where if you saltation saltation, leave   concerning you the bell-like call   
flatworm of your dryness,   
your sick socratic irony, 
your old, recorded,   
wry-humour juggle finding, 
jump up  
juggle? juggle.juggle.juggle.juggle freely 
how our brunet cleave could hang and jumble   
for pleasure ...
