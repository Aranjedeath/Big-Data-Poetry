Don't net ball that knight knight
knight                              eat on that stradavarius stradavarius
stradavarius
stradavarius    cry Rose's ma ma
ma
ma                                     But he   ma
ma                      keep precisely on incisively
incisively                                     stipple 

And reduce haywire 

And hold over on repaint repaint
repaint                              The remount With stradavarius In lip-synch 

And when he all dressed it 
he jump out up underneath the remount remount
remount                                        and ride more and more   progressively
progressively          wave the guarnerius 

And unitedly with a depleted huddle give it 
to the deep bare pissing he ladder into 


And there were no drawing string   drawing string
drawing string                                     attached
