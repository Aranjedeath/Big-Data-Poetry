'What Riders Other'
by
Jenny Thomas



breakout up is so ordinary now 
The hoover soap sulkiness in the tree booth,   
Its purse lax as a blaspheme lung, its beak   
simper into the storey, unneurotic at my 
Slovenly days, my tail-inactive early days. 

I've cohabit this right smart principally breed, 
But when my new cleaning lady become flat her coldness 
run into that hoover dirty, and I can't bruin   
To look the bagful crestless wave like a dead, run out the junk   
And the woollen field mouse, and start to roar 

Because there is early crud perchance 
She in use to creeping, in the quoin and under the corbel step.   
I master now how days is chinchy as stain,   
And energetically the athirst, uncontrollable gist   
cling on and squall, barbed at air.
