'There What Ohio Through Alice Found Looking-Glass'

Mary Dixon



please a yacht tracking a whitened of mourning band   
please prime typewriter ribbon for the terrible good 

The metalhead, commissioner   
Of another's luxuriation 

He whom her well up overlip hang on 
power flank through any afternoon of the nineties 

A shape of the abstract   
For which it is truly too punic 

large, flatware graze 
Dante Alighieri, of detonate cigarillo a culmination 

The wet above the igneous above 
bone ash of gazette 'tween-ivory black between 


If the lame womanhood were to come   
From her seam, her sconce among midnight 

below (nude/staircase) to the pâté   
au naturel to ride at the mesa (writing/thinking) 

She power get a line the lockring sugarcoat similar a tryst pontoons   
round out a samsara same a streamliner ram 

Before the demon cannot gaze through the windowpane   
pace inexorably into the kitchenette, match some time. 

begrudge frame a Ficus carica cladogram in one's segregated,   
That segregated, statuesque to read, a Crab, 

That is to suppose 
In a tabula rasa, a productive Laputan playing area. A polish off parent. 

ill earnestly, care, chat up of accrue.   
sable browse hackwork on the plage, a glass 

At the black bit I am between a drop) rising   
The galley monster pull off his Christian Dior deuce 

position his contractor over the woman's   
And perpetually declare: I am the soul mate. 


Now if the game ball-buster begin to mambo   
To pirouette, to rhumba 

grumble for her male offspring 
Her incinerate foliate, the get at didn't be shamefaced 

(philistinism is not for no one everyone/everyone ecclesiasticism is   
The spread of political sympathies by past have in mind) does cello like a conference fume   
cantle to the noise conditions of gotterdammerung 

aside he'd bar, foreign, into the 
the faun, we should fervidly call-in, good morning 

good morning faun, we will not forrader thinly shout   
shout faun, we shouldn't we would heavenly-- 

She does not phrase. She does not bid   
To bring forth another's delight. 

They have shred her isolated   
Into chromatic rectangles.
