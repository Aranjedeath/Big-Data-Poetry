pricktease 
scent expeditiously above weewee;   
an minute in the frost mellow; 
manus in a beaver fur pin, 
potent jump by 
the shop sort, typographer 
curly-coated retriever jeopardize to her trip up,   
The impale of her fair   
aerobiosis running to nozzle storey. 

Fannie Farmer near to the bayou   
hail 'round for the saloon keeper;   
at most they song under   
and a black in a cartridge 
get out her unsuccessful, her portentous   
touch wilted in the blaze solarise. 

chill on our buttery story, 
unwind in a snowsuit, 
I appreciate her decameter the wear touch 
parlay to the arm,   
cream for make, 
a dark leach of gore   
pour forth from a lacerate sail through. 

sail through 
following leap she will squelch   
down our telegraph, 
emboss on sextet gosling,   
drown for bluewing, 
crock down merle, 
toke muntjac get up in our landscape. 

She hitch on the compost chain reactor, 
shingle at the horse doctor, 
Pisces under improvised tail, 
black-footed ferret out mink coat, 
midwife toad, throwback Hydra, 
any boy wonder battle royal despite venture:   
attend to her neuter diagnose 
forewarn, defeated, neglect, orgasmic 
smirk of her stream.
