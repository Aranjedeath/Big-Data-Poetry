'Leisures Me'
by
James Codrescu



As I river to my   
ally, because I am   
short wind,-Saint Nick, I 

tracer, which was not his   
make, the shadow Tyre 
polish up starfall, what 

can we do against 
starfall, or differently, shall we shall&shall 
why non, bribe a goddamned small gondola, 

hunger, he geteoh, for   
christ's rice beer, glance   
out where glance going.
