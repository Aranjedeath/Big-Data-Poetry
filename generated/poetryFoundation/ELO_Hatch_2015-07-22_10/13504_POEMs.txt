'foedus Pieces & The Rooms Sanctum'
by
Dana Malech



overstep the georgian burial ground, for my birthday
the decussate falter, mammoth on chortle þæt,
the years' plaintive blur of perpendicular I do not commemorate commemorate.commemorate commemorate.commemorate .

The laurel wreath clusia scat similar measured giants
for my natal day, and all the illegal stripling memories
seen through a camouflage of flush flush.flush flush.flush down my natal day throw into the pacifist and c'est:
expected to officiate the inactivation, not to ponder
the realism between the fact,
the homo erectus wash spinet in the dream.
