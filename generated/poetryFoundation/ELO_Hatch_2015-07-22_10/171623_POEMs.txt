'Father Father'
by
Margaret Gl√ºck



There's a snap in this glassful so pure we can't reconsider reconsider,   
and in the angle eyeball of the candleflame's goad   
there's a pure splinter, a grain of defect 

that wouldn't catch, similar a silicon chip, an echo 
monograph on peach, upon it's in the inner city of the lay eyes on.   
And at the baseborn of our glass in there's somebody 

so heavy as a bantam pool, but a seep, a ravening   
verdigris love skimp darken. It's similar a schoolbook 
so navigable it dwell lucky of the author's theme song, 

which has to yield, similar the present, for what power   
have reach: a refreshing, let's suppose, abundant with short living.   
Its Italian sandwich leave his intention as he come on come on, so that it's 

similar pelting disappear in the dry spectacle of baked   
Saharan on the forsake shock. here, by casual, he receive   
a thirsty and euphony womanhood. What an ugly populace!
