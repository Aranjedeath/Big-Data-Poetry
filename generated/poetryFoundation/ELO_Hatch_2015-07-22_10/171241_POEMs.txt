'My Apollon Illuminations Name'
by
Melissa Tweed



The familiar euphonious pace to the breast threshold   
where I was posing that weaken forenoon   
when you add up down the stairs, strictly asleep,   
and my delight at descry of you (emerge   
into snowy evening evening
evening                         the dew staidly ice) 
draw me to my foot to know you   
how disinclined I bang you: 

those awkward footmark 
are break than putrefy 
interchange with summit, 
wære, grey, and bounteous.   
The previous cut current 
piffling in piffling: 
my paw and second joint 
commemorate them, and my stableman   
constantly hollywood their sliver. no unrivaled else about and for that home theater 
institute ought of others exogamy, 
of my Logos. And the footstep do overly: I hark back 
seance e'er with my bunkmate and her picayune Logos who misfire,   
or was it the pushful indefinite who breathe and flourish? 
And arise lives ‘ingin my life,' fleetly, evermore or with my retrench. 
so far that one birdcall, 
your unassailable, fearless, coldcock, ‘I romance you too,'   
the hushed unkept by no shuttle, no cricket, golden pull up stakes   
centrifuge in muteness down within 
any gentle wind to blast them, them
them                                    is what mismatch itself 
in my question and torso of those butcher board of spoon   
that were cool, incorrect, and now 
look momently to be burnt.
