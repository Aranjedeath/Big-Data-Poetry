Claude SÃ¡enz



There is no windlessness in this brassie. 
The quieten of this pass 
Is the clean of my get a line 
The strait I does 

There is no visual sensation in this clearing. 
This barbican of solarize concealing 
The clunker ashtray is pilfer 
burden from nicety. 

Only my plant is love's nonsuch. 
The passion I could find out 
In these mihrab anticipate no groupie, 
Is the insubstantial, 

The vague, unanalysed, 
Unabsolute all-night; 
It is nevere of whatsoever, 
In everything comprised.
