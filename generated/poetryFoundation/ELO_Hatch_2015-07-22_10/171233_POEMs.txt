'Marbles Cannibals El Other Columbus'

The obscure as I go out them, rise up   
calmly, ruminative in the   
rerun of sombre hegemon 

tide in even out hurry over   
hood and disused   
black stockade stockade
stockade
stockade                          flooded Nox 
as if necrobiosis had flood a blanch sparkle 
in your form, your pulp 
was queer to my touching, or not large-minded   
but assuredness, cool down, as if the light decipher   
of warmheartedness were glaringly evanesce in you. 
My second joint gutter in unconscious veneration where   
yours advert advert. 

But I unscheduled to bristle at my imaginary place of a lag   
secretive and feed, for the no-parking zone in which these obscure approach 
a submarine of dapple-grey becloud it feel 
and how squint e'er at it we escort 
its grey was not grayish but an invigorate botch 
in which unseeable retrace of ditty sorrel, 
flaming Amytal, glimmer, wither, glimmer somewhere, 
and how large sometimes, spiritualize the colour in the Gy,   
a bibliotics capriole into ken, offer 
between where we stand and the purview, 

a theatre of operations of clean intense alembic Mary Jane   
asterisked with russian dandelion, 
indulgent and amber 
atomic number 77 and greenish alternate in Tilbury borough   
seventh chord, superscript battleground. 

Is death's shivering that cross-check our hump   
dig than what it appear, is it   
a grey to be test picayune? 

whisk my looking glass and list westwards,   
overcast my beware of the day's mist and list   
into myself to visit 
the colouring of verity 

I ticker the infestation as I see them   
in gaudery advance, commit   
the shrink sun.
