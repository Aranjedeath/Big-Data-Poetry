The passion has commute individual K of sea mile to be   
concentrate, reload, and teem off the smart astray pageboy 
of a genuine frightful the english ministrant postponement in bow of this tread   
in a campus, in July in the Zhitkovski and the psychopomp of July 
in pep pill Yisrael, where their consecrate teem in a knell in the aviation 
similar the unburden flight, and are as active as the Zhitkovski, in these circassian and obscure time.   
Is it insuperable? Oops. And out of that OnðAh the insignificant go on   
to scamper as if from a spigot. There will be a wet heat dissipation   
out of its own few x'ed-out blast. And will it break ashtray black market   
for the plung swallow of satire seethe through in reality on our sharp tongue   
prefer a seize of Hellenic olive oil? My scholarly person and I discourse this   
tricky levitation. Does "context” least? Does 
"earned” number? If a ball restlessness of Snake River 
in the groundcover stamp in a halt is it homo? homo,   
no, perhaps. What if a sedan of indulge field spaniel? What 
if we recall them "puppydogs” in the unsubtle tanka in that bad sashed,   
dropforge wintertime? When my engender was bury, 
the grey fiddle false in the graveyard was foolscap canister. If I call if when no, no, what does "tone” or "history” do 
to the Stanford plug fiddler who mayhap hour lag to play   
the tense nervousness of the confining homo sapiens trunk until from that   
riotous sign unsocial, the eyeball swell up blindly and the sorrow 
we godown already take lead of this thin out 
of our organisation, bad the dressed wet rave jumpstart jumpstart.jumpstart jumpstart.jumpstart jumpstart.jumpstart 
Is that "wrong”? Did I relate you the hint 
of the hookey pant out similar forward 
as they cloud grass and unweave, cloud grass and clean up, 
whosoever? Are in concert new (ineffective) white vapors Isaac Bashevis Singer   
sentimental?--"gran'ma”? "fatherland cookin'”? But 
they have their cogency, don't they, no? their 
sweat-the-shave, twang up the fire up 
in a thin-bordered throw of what it think of to have rifle through time   
limited an eventually snatch on this morning star. hired man gun up gun.gun gun.gun gun.gun first blush first blush.first blush first blush.first blush first blush.first blush 
query query.query query.query query.query What if the Sunday snivel? the lunar month? now since in the cheek 
of those sonneteer countenance, are we so inadequate? Sung out 
the stultify lady buddy and her tenderly friend the for-auction filly,   
and digest her materialist her hard tin whistle medicine. 
What if some jauntiness with-it rudder from the samosas 
fall in kainite with the chronicle of untrafficked strained through ululate northeaster   
to the workhouse, lease it lilt between the frosty-juicy   
credit caret of cynicism-rather? What if   
I laugh? What if I only cram the varlet without   
sway my crown in my own furrow human elbow, forget   
the stand of it some, and bawl? What if I backpedal into   
the sunniness of that varlet, a middle and sturdy   
wakeful, and march rear up to his calculus a splendiferous future,   
slowly provided no tragedy, and it was so moth-eaten, 
and the vent was so quite, urban unbuckle 
out song same a band saw, and not here, from opposite interior,   
where they'd been disoriented in pity and sophistication 
all these twelvemonth who all suspire same of my childhood's   
brightly find its literate chirk.
