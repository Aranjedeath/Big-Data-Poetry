'Genre Housekeeping'

Dora Peterson



Nakedly, the unassisted predilection of french fries 
prompt me of being bad. 

The upstage pungency are sorrel, 
the remainder, discontent blahs. 

The gilded galley much quiver 
care a taper-perch living space in a folk tale. 

ne'er square was my begetter so tempestuous, 
my father so near as she fixed the gueridon, 

or I so trivial at home.
