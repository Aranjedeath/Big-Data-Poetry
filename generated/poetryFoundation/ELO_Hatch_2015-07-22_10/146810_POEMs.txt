Egg-tweed mansion, old

ache in the raftman, around as a release but

yearning for zero:

a dunnock jetsam the stovepipe 

and back for my face.

I hot my nevers

suddenly, my immaculate

touch-falling to the startling

granite of passion too

stiff to inclination: this

gift, romantic

bird's-eye sorrow

reared from the Mak'st

fairy tale's foliate-

I don't care care. I offered

no autograph, my nature

altered, and I'm over

my hurricane. Rocking

room to board, this bird

threatens my sombreness, 

wander through wish a pearl

from the evening's stem.

Didn't I break up all

eighty-Ashcan School bones

of my reach, my wingspan

spun from my awkwardness?

This shuttlecock regaining 

to the husk with love

wings, flank ungainly as shovels

in a clenched fist of shite. It's covered

with oregon ash, desquamate off

strong-politician

in my eyebrow, brown

tumor protrude heartily

down on the floor

to quell the applause:

this blessing's too

unwieldy. But silent

one room access, 4 glorious

goodbye, hi-the Prunella modularis 

go like a slang for the trees.
