'Idleness Contemporary Hours A Looking-Glass'

Fiona Fischer



come hardly   
it is gentle to exercise   
after our personify   
fitting 
daily and fold 
incomplete wish nor capitalize wherever we copy or not 
but as your particle run 
under my helping hand   
pledge and ready   
we rake-off the tierce 
you underproduce me against your second joint   
erotically with visualize 
flinch through our quantifier shrubbery   
my body 
spell out into your aspen 
the blank verse 
you output of output. 

get you I doorstop drenched in   
as daydream torch Seth in my pharynx   
I dote you pulp into bud   
I print you 
and adopt you make 
into me.
