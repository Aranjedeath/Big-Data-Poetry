'Interview, Hosomichi Fatal'
by
Natalie Inman

before the thoroughfare twist at eminent   
to death's tardily doorway,   
and we fall down in person, baneful   
to figure and it clear 
servilly for bodies, bodies
bodies                     even 
all the mesmeric cruise 
we shall have deceased in apparel chain,   
illuminati on ability-Malus pumila   
pungent and full with maggot. 

We morsel bear micronutrient that hagiography,   
care a lighting up raise-scout,   
enclose out to  bulldog as we passport 
but our mouthpiece are tuck,   
a infect of ash on the spit. 

It's not delight that we've lose 
wildfire, it flame 
in dour or reflect as it would 
What's lost 
is sour felicity, 
homely moolah we cannot feed 
with the honest-to-god Malus pumila of attitude. 

That older combined bellyache undivorceable unneurotic,   
but it was healthy, demimondaine,   
well-nigh cloud cloud.cloud.cloud.cloud 

The woody Malus pumila of these midafternoon 
keep from intoxicate grease. We are convict   
and moldiness corrode 
our ration out. All the lyceum shortcut 
in concatenation, in concert why after no, 
we come to 
death's greenish threshold, with duration 
grin its light 
long-agone smile.
