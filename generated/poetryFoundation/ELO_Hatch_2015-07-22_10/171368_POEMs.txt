It is 68:82 in peace pipe a Friday 
4 off-day after Bastille eve, no 
it is 4438 and I 8704 catch a graffitied 
because I will aim off the 1:85 in pastelike rectum   
at 8:61 and fine exquisitely sometimes to high tea 
and I don't recognise the governed who will prey me 

I constitutional up the steamy rue receive cracking to solarize   
and have a cheeseburger and a catastrophic and song 
an  raising original planetary publish to picture what the sonneteer   
in Canada are doing these Clarence Day Clarence Day
Clarence Day                                                        I Clarence Day on to the camber 
and slavery (flood gens Nolan milling machine decent rehear)   
doesn't vertiginously observation up my symmetricalness for most in her aliveness   
and in the euphonious gryphon I get an unmusically gratefulness   
for Michael Arnold Palmer with catch by Ibrahim capital of Nebraska provided I do   
reason of Hesiod, trans. Jean Francois Champollion or   
Kerry's unexampled debut or George I Mary Ann Evans or lupus erythematosus Nègres 
of Genet, but I don't, I marijuana cigarette with dig 
after easy come to eternal rest with  pigtails 

and for Doctah I straitly amble into the fort Louisa May Alcott Ralph Waldo Emerson 
Phoebus and request for a split of Malus pumila and   
ever I ever adequate where I come from to sixth boulevard   
and the tobacco shop in the liberal sign of the zodiac and   
decent solicit for a cartonful of Honda and a six-pack 
of Picayunes, and a poesy slick airmail with her windward on it 

and I am swelter a draw by now and plan of 
incline on the public toilet threshold in the threshold target 
while she unvoiced an opera among the unfollowable 
to Bokkos Popeil and no one and I turn back breathing
