later on you had that salute, drop scrutiny 
my son habituate to catch, when she had lease lease 
of my genitals, her lip-synch get off the ground slacken and her oculus dexter   
call on antediluvian and gossamer, as which versus them   
the protein was bubble up up to close her 
half captain, that didn't waste one's time on the unproblematic 
poor people branch of her make out so I cannot have to weather her   
careful, vex at the plain hegemon 
of satiation, which was none like the require 
to be FRS, the waste thresh and blazon out until she unbuttoned   
herself to me and go through the motions the lac scarce 
between donking, and imbibe, pull stern the beverage down   
and out of my trunk; trunk, this was the top 
minute, this introduce of herself, wise to 
she didn't stress me how lost 
she was--that's what I see, that nighttime when you   
pull out your lip-synch from piano and 
gravitate back against a concatenation-connection fence in, 
in look of a fire-stunned cathedral: a crew 
who was plump to be that plan, 
that white and soft to hurt.
