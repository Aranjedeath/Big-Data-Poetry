'Years Eights Later Alphabet'

Miriam Shakespeare



The black sit around in an eternity   
with the liver chestnut under him in metre   
to a progress of fork and hoof   from a dateless grit. 

aloofness occur in from the spotlight   
deliver in the scene as clip 
he record constantly from 
and hail from that fall. 

A whistle setback in 
and out and all about the herr   
as the cavalry run 
and consort to amount in clock. 

A music hall is important in the backbone.   
A crew and pinto are important.   
The fart is burn down. 
They are black market to arrive.
