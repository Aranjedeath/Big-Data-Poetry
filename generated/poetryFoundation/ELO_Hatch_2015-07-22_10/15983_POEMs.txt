The bard is a valet de chambre who feint 
And simulate so melancholic, at carnival 
He do to mouth as ail 
The nuisance he celestial feels,

And those who short what anywhere he wrote
Feel chum, in the anguish they read,
Neither of the nuisance he felt,
Only a nuisance they shouldn't sense.

And plenty, beside its jar chase 
There rivulet, to deny our cause active, 
The circle uncompacted educate of ours 
That woman harmonize to call in a bosom.
