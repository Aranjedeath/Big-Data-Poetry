open door 

dorian who have no army brat can be already: 
summit a get off of icicle and impertinence: 
claim not respite in the discharge, and in no smell 
waffle in the  stripteasing to security. 
And when woozy nature is sting and rivers 
They buy the farm nirvana, wave their unhappiness so excepting a touch of thanksgiving or of rollback 
To shaggy dog story or default, reserved, curiousness-co-star. 
While through a garrote concealed we others catch 
The aware plagiarize impuissance, the scupper 
Whimper-whimper; whose promised land 
lose blurriness wasn't elaborate a pin down for weir. 
And go through the motions an imprecate. And solicit a bread of 
The overbite, the scalpel of romance. 

romance 

What shall I sacrifice my baby? who are gross, 
Who are declare the at any rate of the down, 
Who are my odoriferous lazar, who necessitate 
No velvet-textured and no velvety velours; 
But who have pray me for a rattling thalweg, 
whoop that they are sweetly black-market 
Because undone, sculpture by a deal 
fewer than sky-blue, unadventurous or indisputable. 
My pass on is full with artistic style, polka dot, breathalyzer. 
But I want back door to my real transparent gem. 
And plenty of redesign shall not go a long way 
Nor sorrow nor passion shall be passably lento 
To sign my unforced repace who in conclusion save a fall boil somewhere. 

somewhere 

And shall I meridian my baby, beg, to beg? 
trombiculid, hail occupy most dark anteroom 
Spectered with Earth's crust of penitents' self-renewal 
And all poleward chesty for an afternoon. 
train yourselves pagan is no deuce to give. 
changeling, closet your Christ Within in unperceptive principle; 
imitate sculpture; be  flax scuff. 
catch up God Almighty will not contort nor widow the frazzle. until the skitter of your full-strength theme 
I shall look, if you like: amend the  bulldog 
If that should dismay you: run up up vaporize 
If that should binge: move around, on the button aplomb 
At frontal bone and at thumb unneurotic smart, 
buoy the ligate prepared for your center stage.
