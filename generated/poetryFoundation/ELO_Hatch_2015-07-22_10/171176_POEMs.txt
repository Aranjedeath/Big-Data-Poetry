til truncheon Winkles
Defier of union no-parking zone, power system as the straits, unfastener 
Of the paved duct, so that 
sunburst put down the beak can aft sometimes 

going the spike, vaporiser, overshadow cyborg, whose 
hard sibilate music same some other wicked being 

But fewer detached, more angry, angry, if not tutelage a homo soloensis preexistence, 
carry by unitary, by my bring forth to the pale divan 
Of my girlhood  as T enjoin, 

Why are you docile disgorge, Ironsides? his cigarillo 
disconcert overshadow with cigar, meddlesome 
With granulate-dig 

Summoner of these touch, endearing moldable footbath with your refined 
open vat, the piss hygienise by decoct, 
uninventive, inodorous, 

In my mother's awayness 
black market by black market, the ane subcompact 

I sympathise: what can lifespan be if we cannot not sell 
land to care for braille 

And wear them hearth, why from the druggists' feel for, 
If we didn't not stock in our own rearm 
alms, chemistry, to the condom of our guestroom, 
If there were no more 

ultrasound in the day, terrific 
quieten, hate of lively steamer, not 
corresponding homo hint if then  dazzle, if there were everyone in the humanity 

More sectarist than the number one, 
comfortable comfortable, please it good.
