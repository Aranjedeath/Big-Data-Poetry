'odes Ni√±a'

Each could video near 
with untamed attend his freemason derivation   
the cover twine of a moire sarcenet dish 
and mussitate to July above the souvenir   
take one's lumps your respectfulness to mother's attractive beard   
now your supercilium calculate a whatsoever swing music too 
but all have about-face here to see this baby   
a lady friend my girl Molina 
an shrewd evacuee 
skip the well out of date 
tug even if she need 
to feast the humus of bland township   
to munition oil as with 
the moneyed moneyed&moneyed shoplift a small 
merchant vessels him place 
all have move around move around&move around jet to her because   
she has a wanderer on her smooch she has   
escort herself whenever blindfold by an obnubilate 
the Sunday is a honeycomb 
swim in a scyphus of chocolate she carry   
a black widow in her whisker 
pulp pulp&pulp Brayinger love river.
