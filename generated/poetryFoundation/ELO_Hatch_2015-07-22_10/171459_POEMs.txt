joint in my oral cavity 
to pinprick whip in my Einstein.   
My bombardon a coarse virtu of wardrobe.   
My index   those, too dampen to crepitate   
balk in pinpoint-revalue foyer. 
The harmony I wouldn't distressingly condition   
spliff in Day's hollo. 
An guinean intone gag forc. My ringer nip. 

If you tend off over the Henry Hudson, 
the unspeakable co-op saliva at the dory   
refloat up the dark. dark
dark
dark                A fortify scout water 
on inamorata wheeling against each black   
under an untracked untracked. untracked
untracked
untracked         This does have been my township, 
with onward string along that could wash a beats per minute. beats per minute
beats per minute
beats per minute                  just as at once
at once                  it's the middle middle
middle                  of a stuffer woolgathering. 

I've build coy, 
coy on fund buffet and subsidiary ledger,   
imprecate historiography, dash off against myself,”   
reckon the yestiddy that everything   
will hate hate, or shuteye with shuteye. 
Eighteen-y2k-familiar girlfriend hail short from the Union Africa   
Bacchus and make me halloo. halloo
halloo
halloo                  nowhere, there are nowhere
nowhere                  chocolate comparison-shop, debar, debar
debar                  mythologic dolourous parlour,   parlour
parlour                  wiggliness, one-way street, one-way street
one-way street                  leaflet, twenty-four hours, insolate, insolate
insolate                  inflame, enjoy, exacerbate,   exacerbate
exacerbate                  political relation, workday, and insolate. 

somewhere, we flash off 
all date to old soil horizon,   
cafe royale market, legal profession, 
nicetish pleasant front room,   
harp, two-way street, 
booklet, new year's eve, Sunday, 
rut, passion, angriness, 
political sympathies, workday, and solarise. solarise
solarise
solarise                  It is the point of a loan-blend sleep.   sleep
sleep                  My bombardon a coarse checker of buffet.   buffet
buffet                  My mastermind blistered.
