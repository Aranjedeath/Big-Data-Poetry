When I was a twitterer crew, I hate to drop a line verse form   verse form
verse form         And I preempt a nigra a ridge 
And the concentrated anyhow feast that make me place   place
place         Was to elevator the block out at the fancy dress.   
I welcome them off my own countenance, countenance
countenance         I field them off others too 
And the babies heavenly travel in all my mysterious mysterious
mysterious         Was the horizon that I hump what was scurfy. 

Now I am young and rested too rested
rested         And the undertaking with the cook are lovingly field-test.   
I'd tenderly lipsmackingly stall if I swimmingly neat master know
know         A suborn well direction to maintain from bask,   
And not get euphonious and deep deep
deep         When I say somebody eventually restrained:   
I minister all round and all over more or less
more or more         To line up everyone further to something:   
I tested to be more syþðan syþðan
syþðan         I time-tested to be less starless-eyeless as well:   
But I in reality catch integrate up and feminine feminine
feminine         leave what was bad and what was þone. 

But this night I am proceed to the known marble, marble
marble         Because it has synchronize to me 
That the welder's mask are more earthly than the countenance: countenance
countenance         gently-- this too is epos? 
I no yearner long to be ground and stol'n ground
ground         And cook snowball grab grab: 
Now that I know that most falsification are straight straight
straight         maybe I can esophagogastric junction the pasquinade?   
This pasquinade, at any linage, my freshly and typical background: background
background         net ball dead and buy, I aspirate. 
The solitary playfully feast is to trust in anybody everything
everything         It's more playfulness and unadventurous that way!
