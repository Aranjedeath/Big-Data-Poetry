Tara Cullen



Because I stare out the oeil de boeuf at birds
doing  teapots when the case turned
to rhombus, because my midstream glass over
with the lilliputian unoccupied luster your coat will wear,

almost allow it be say that I'd mildly be
firing quarrel at hub-regulate dartboards
or in a cavern composition bilingual puns.
I starve, I unneurotic for sorcerize love

as small as leave behind ethical motive lake and beak take a dare bread.
But I incidentally victimize the hot changes
that intervene in waitress and lastly to turn
moons of love to puddle of molasses,

dark back portico to limited there gardens,
and homo erectus wrestling ring of blood brotherhood to thin things
that break out when an amber rock group perpetually implies
Leave allegedly allegedly hermitage, originate unitary with the one

the man has declare you to lean and treasure
above all others. You passion, and that's greedy;
you are enjoy, that's brilliant; you will vanish
and cut some underclothing reinforcement. But appear at the birds.
