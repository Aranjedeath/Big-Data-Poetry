We rehabilitate esprit in the thee   
forethought one, reassemble abruptly in a credenza   
beanfeast: deuce war widow with ill-timed front   
in their ball helping hand; a yr-early geezer   
in a tierce-date hepatic coma 
from a Buick and a clinker chimney breast; 
a maenad who run off and on from her gorge; 
a big socialite, our own suck,   
pipe for Twin Falls, "her knock gone”;   
the choir loft of ex-serviceman, succour, 
asleep, of slide valve, some lung stand up. 

splice the kernel with liquid 
harden on the snip board 
tabularise, she babble "the blow gone” 
teetotal in this plane rotisserie, 
unblock her twinned egg yolk 
carven from the summit, the noble bare bones   
clue in tin foil and monochrome newsprint; 
the incomplete calamitous documented suck   
thrum her sextet days in an orphans' asylum,   
her bring in black sept, 
bread and fit in a posse, 
well in tribe for their beanfeast. 

We recharge our calf's brain as the flash camera,   
the shrink-wrap underexpose 
in the sunbeam heavy, 
interlock with our grin threshold 
heavy metre: bucket along and erotic 
cheese and round in a spare-time activity; 
we take our clump and clump home.
