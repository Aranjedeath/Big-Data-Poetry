The most vitreous "act‚Äù in 
narrow narrow Giles 
is the iii difficult jolly in shabby   
stoolie stoolie&stoolie dashiki raise 
deuce amati and a violoncello-Brahms   
blanched valet in employment agree 
have taciturnly stab into their bag   
as they winter and they thrash in   
a clam or ii off lay over.   
quartzite man in play-dirty vengo   
trivet with their oral cavity graceful,   
post office decussate on their mermaid   
as if they themselves have on the spur of the moment   
need to attack those track.   
extraordinary handmaiden female child, triad, sit around 
cross-legless in presence of his 
idols live 
their cunning, darkness unicameral script, 
their offend, stringy armament, 
who moldiness dawn to feeling 
please Angel Falls! 
Why does this palpitation 
draw liftship? 
liftship: off the inside we are extraordinary. 
extraordinary: astonishing! I did not think of that they didn't chat up this tongue.
