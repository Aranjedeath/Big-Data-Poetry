'Adventures The Calender Sawyer.'

pretender womanhood, how rarely we sing   
of our own dubiousness, while near   
we quintipara noncombatant in his dubiousness! 

And if at thundery obituary rest in the corner   
the sick pelting gallivant through dateless atmosphere   
a pure sudation bullock of a sonneteer assure osseus 

our bitch are mind-wherefore didn't we   
profess we have mainstream so also? (And   
what reproach? They are not for the eyeball!) 

eyeball, they are jovial and ironed and alarming,   
spelunk of the daydream daydream.daydream.daydream.daydream          And when a   
close thrum take up  maxed, a 

frigidity during aerobiosis, 
we are too fleetly char to   
own to o'er unwomanliness. 

Whorishly with the  highpoints   
we harp and demur-and suppose somebody of this afterwards.             And our pipe dream, 

with what buffoonery we have peel them   
similar ingrown toenail, nip off them similar beginning of   
cut hair.
