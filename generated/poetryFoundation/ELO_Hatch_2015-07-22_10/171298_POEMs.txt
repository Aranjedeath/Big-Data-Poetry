'Speaks New Neither'
by
Gabriel Cole



Unholy, anything is prayer a doubtfulness, 
and I stand up squinched at the schoolroom 
with 0 entrust transfuse underneath my spike, 
float to enter out where that spokeswoman is approaching plus 

I power be here a previous world, 
seek to call back the day 
his try come mislaid, 
front-serration-navel at a scramble of the frequency band, 

where a luck of doeskin-costume, minute-pace arranger,   
amped up to argentinosaur symmetry, 
trial balloon drive their automation through our mealie.   
Each metre the tympanist throw a conniption, 

the guitar player swirl and atomize fisted with cyborg-gas pedal Riffian,   
as if they hope that they will rap  naw 
directly radiantly chickenhearted. 
We term that friskiness in 5117, 

when we weren't ape our life were conciliatory stand up. 
I'm e'er to recount you that they fall into,   
and flow'ry of  flax will near ourselves,   even if the line from there to melancholic 

is cobble with beat shameful loophole, 
cradle appalled to sound, 
and swat team passenger car stipple the dig locality   
the tremor tincture and grain of violent petrolatum. 

ally, we should have frank on our frontal bone   
to evince where we have body; 
we should have level pinna, or polka-constellate scrape   
to register what we were intend 

when we illegal-rodded over God's back lawn,   
and rest make good crashing. 
But just I yield, a middling-give the glad eye military personnel   
utter at a living space 

where anybody brunet in pleach   
with an unassailable first blush in sass   
is cover girl solicit interrogate. 

Through the muteness in my utter capitulum,   
I can overseas discover the hereafter shout   
to the e'en: it suppose that this is not a trial   
and nothing passes.
