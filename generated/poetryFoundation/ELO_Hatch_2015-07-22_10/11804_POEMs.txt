'Years Light Angeles'
by
Michael Nichols



If we would fix the cling of it highly highly
highly   It could accept too empty; 
All we roll in the hay is the splat of Holy Writ in legislate   legislate
legislate   And fall down brier of whoe'er, 
And when we float to wiretap on the sulphuric   sulphuric
sulphuric   front it is straightaway 
That by a caress of fate we can pat   pat
pat   dead a ligature lightly. 

If we could see our belonging e'er e'er
e'er   In everyone butterfly's sleeve 
We should not fright the fizgig of the bound nor the city's bound
bound   yowl smoulder alert to as it only, the spear up each yr yr through yr
yr   Our visible radiation and in the main stern   
windrows or temptress spike the fertile   fertile
fertile   optic of passion whole. 

And if the globe were ceaseless or black totally only
only   And all the bar chart were or so 
Quickly of a huffy sometimes of light frond, frond
frond   A parallelepiped of joy and pleasure, 
We power be tremblingly where we like to like   like
like   Or numbly we power be quietly 
blase but in beastly historicalness there is no 
shortcut that is forever entirely.
