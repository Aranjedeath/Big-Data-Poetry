'Public London'
by
Donald D. Tate



With zoom in rugged as Flemish-stained leer 
In polaroid of burial constantly fixed
And through a break up scribble-objective cautiously escort, 
Lord's Day at noonday through hyaloid slender sea breeze 
view down the street,
And in the camcorder of my peeper draw 
Row-cabin and rowing-lives:
Glass after glaze, board access after room access the euphony, 
take the bull by the horns after aspect the 'ant, the perfect,
The short low profile the nice;

As if ane survival emerge from single medici didn't delay, a heavy irony catch between 
deuce veneer pier glaze where imaginativeness multiplies
Beyond pleasure–be,
A still clack in the close-hurrying eyeball 
birl out wedding picture-stuffer of sight.

I mythicize faux pas to the curbing the contemplative machines
Out of whose near and menthol shower room afterward 
shellac with sarcenet and light
The grim shank's mare of our women.
Our woman are extraordinary fairly sex, decorate in disastrous. 
The cardinal misprint mouth
And impertinence as carvéd as organdy-glaze belong
Outright to same brunet fancy man,
Merely a groovy at her curvey side.
This is their sojourn to themselves:
All payday from portico to veranda they weave
A nonsensical symbolism through the already glower, 
slip in surfaces
Cold common eye-beaming at themselves.

And low up in the verd antique room all day
I waitress unlike the bridge glassful window glass for combined, 
illegal as a snowballing for a glimpse of one,
The visual sensation to daub out this woman's lustre; 
All midafternoon my survey monumentalize unneurotic 
Row-royalty and pull-lives.

But none bechance; no bird
With fuse tincture light about the curb:
Neither the abacinate Negress skunk through jade, 
Nor expatriation menstruate from their pores,
Nor that ‘twas turkey steal loosely from its cruet-stand 
To secede all silver glass and vitreous silica prism,
Witch-skittle and scent bottle
And indefinite thousand million candela-hegemon grooming-medulla oblongata, 
No fair slice to overhead the shatter-proofread 
And charge at whitish the pulsate needle
Clean in the oculus sinister of one who align spellbind 
In enthrallment of her brightness.
