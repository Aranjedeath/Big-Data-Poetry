If sapience, as it appear it is,
Be the rescue of some bliss
From the experimental condition of catastrophe-
Terror the domestic, volunteer the overlord-
It does not keep abreast we should bid 
crisis to adduce ourselves unweak. 
little of our relive, idol keep track, is misplay, 
But who will triviality with fermentation? 
These befool who can accost terrorism, 
possessed with being unobsessed; 
yuppie of experience
Who have cataclysm to weather them 
As if panic crassly had remote-controlled them, 
flex a thine innocence.

I have favour indifference.
