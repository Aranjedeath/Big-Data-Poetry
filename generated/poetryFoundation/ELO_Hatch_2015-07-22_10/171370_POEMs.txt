sunshine disappearance 
the shopfront water shamrock of cartridge holder. 
date to date 
they brag the book binding, 
they individualize modere 
that if we need to receive surface surface&surface enticing   
(brilliant golden, tempting any) 
we essential for goddamned steady 
shoot up the education of existent selsyn,   
or sizable excavation 
ourselves 
a diametrically dunkeln fishpond. 

yesterday of break someone's heart, lunar day of run down, sidereal day of nawashi 
in that society of jesus, of necessity. 

In the Lord's Day 
all the subtitle are field-test 
to fell-pronominal phrase like rainbow trout pool 
debase, the acme tender injury, red-ink-violent   
rage peroxide as soon as heavy, shell 
speech that velleity my eye   
same moving company on the mews stuff pier glass, 
a pinpoint when I pass off to   
work out towards myself toward&toward wherever   
I'm rifle 
overly. I am not 
a ordinary crew. All I deficiency 
is to be a boulevardier to this life.
