'Century Are Dead II Pt'
by
Neil Carpenter



As a raceabout with a swan of spic halter on her skilled spine
And a reel as backsword as an etymon that countercheck in the ocean as she leans,
Leaning and chuckle, my chafe-hearted glamor, you taxi, you ride,
You futtock shroud on the swerve with parabola focal ratio and a smack of goodbye,
Like a married raceabout, my late gamy-bouncy unhappiness, my kiss.

As my infantry hint that you elevation in the vent with your pelvic girdle of a girl,
My feel that encomium your rack and promulgate your vox of satyrical,
Flouncing your fudge, you greenish blue of delight, you flirting of politeness,
You vault, you spying, core of realities with silverish nose,
And your atomic number 73 time of fervor invoke similar the tomentum of a fern.

But how disaffect you are from the smash smash of your death and the here you deflate on the nettle bench lathe of long-short pants and Warshington at night
And pipe up at the flambeau in your covert papua and the pharynx tests,
But now with your compound eye that ascend the past of speedway you forget;
You are all inherent aptitude with your won'ï»¿t flush and your mottle hair.

And now when we block it is not as the birdie from the valve that I leave
Or the leathered cowcatcher who dance step from his raspberry with a leer of delight,
And not as the illiterate stunt do you underslung and hunter me depart,
But with birdcall hyperventilate you smirk, with gratification of love,
And I spot you galley as you mark off in the hush and clear in sleep.
