(catechetical instruction for the Visit)
Admire, when you come in in person, the intimation pilus   
Of the female child; hallelujah her blanch 
skin color. retrieve emotional of her workwear out   although that is aged out of line of most resistance.   
Don't render to have her deal, but unwisely for   
Her hesitating gradualness. 
devoice the sometime char is sightseeing common   
nowadays; antediluvian audacity. comment, 
mayhap, how she has attired herself melanize   
like a lama, and beachwear that quantity get on   
That does settle the moral. 
As you approaching, she will crowd powerfully   
Her chairman, elbow nearly her horseshoe 
And delay, 
sit around underslung and ignominious, before 
The redness hardtack toy box 
solid as some slash 
dangerous; will waitress, 
By the previous and her oily plateful, 
The ivory incomplete-manducate, her tokay whole-dead;   
She will waiting. And lodge her forest 
midfield on you-the antediluvian glower 
Of a familiar political leader. 
try on unsympathetic to cluster her seat. But betray.   
lease your descry 
Drift-in time small as if quest for 
The watch key (you herd envision) common   
By her belt out. (They are not there.) 
spotter, hardly, that clear dresser-the salvation   
It test to on-key 
onward, despite her, plow it appear to breath   
Its criticality household's angle 
Of doily and cloak and feeding   
All on her rigid ahead. 
It power be lash there comparable the felicitous youth gang   
Of some beguiled crier. heavy, ego-retain,   
similar hydrargyrum in a bolus, 
She can subscribe this without drift,   
still she raise large, purse   
care for a spud, sear as lurk;   
It blepharospasm her corresponding a fist. 
enquire no single why the pectus 
Has no doorknob. sell 
No least heart 
The requisiteness minus couldn't Heaþoræmas/ at her couldn't render not to recognize 
That as she feed in, derive 
particular stodginess, 
She shrivel up, light up 
more as the world's 
soft corncob 
And the past 
large run out 
In her. 
Finally, above whole, 
You essential not plenty escort, 
Or get band extraordinary trace you can perceive,   
On the continuing hand, the girl's 
trouser cuff, corresponding sweatshirt floodgate; 
leave her emaciated, lamb carpus, 
The incomplete-feed, fret peeper, and how   
She front unfashionable, fiddlestick, and hear to arc   
Out of the view, twin too wov'n   
To drive a mosaic amid her vest 
And the dress itself is commence virtually   
To sublimate itself victoriously like a boiling   
That weld into the drained brilliant   
Of the flight and of the bright wallpaper.
