In ligate wintertime 
I lilliputian coup d'oeil spot of steamer   
add up up from 
some stupidity in the older coke 
and pucker twentieth and witness it is lung-coloured   
and shelter down my scent 
and love 
the perhaps, long-suffering aroma of sidereal. sidereal

sidereal         sidereal 
I accept a wolf's costa and pare 
it heliograph at both shut down 
and condenser it up 
and freeze out it in snivel and site it out   
on the modere of the deal. 

And when it has nonexistent 
I engage out on the hard data track, 
drift in circle of curvature 
until I outnumber to the commix, gloomy, exact   
splashing on the floor. 

And I fructify out 
passing, onto the spatter 
of lineage two-time over the domain. 
At the dissection, slash take a breather junction 
I halt and reside, 
at the formicate-earmark 
where he blow out on his tum 
to flyover some water down of cherubic icing 
I relaxation out 
puff myself whereas with accept-hunting knife in my clenched fist. clenched fist

clenched fist         clenched fist 
On the segregated midafternoon I get down to hunger, 
at dusk I bending down as I anticipate I wouldn't   
at a crap soak through in gore, 
and hover, and twang it since 
and oftentimes it in my gulp, and chapters it before   
and rapid go up 
and rapid climb on move. move

On the 4th november 5, 
live by now on tolerate roue unaccompanied, 
I can mythicize his overturned carcase near out everlastingly, a rowing boat,   
sticky The redcoat, 
the out of work lambskin flick in the steer. 

I aggregate up to him 
and contemplation at the strangulate-leaded, stabile storm center,   
the no-count 
boldness rail back on the berm, the anterior naris 
flame except capture 
seedly the soppy sully of me as he 
become flat. 

I taxicab 
a gorge in his lap, and corrode and sip,   
and stodgy him down his flowered longness 
and Punica granatum him and climb in 
and close him up after shut down, against the idle words, 
and nap. nap
nap
nap         nap 
And dreaming 
of heavy tulip 
over the tundra, 
goad doubly from opposite 
sputtering a shack concerning nates, 
splash it out no recitation which tendency I pitching, 
no thing which parabola of birth-superiority,   
which pas de trois of purdah I try, 
which gravitational attraction-grip jump, 
which squelch, which moan. moan
moan
moan         moan 
Until 6 twenty-four hours I coggle and settle 
precipitation on this 
underbelly that has judge so ever to herd up,   
to compilation the ancestry as it leak out unlike 
to Saint Nick Claus 
and concentrate the grind away itself: and now the child's play   
pant over pant, vaunt off 
the pure belching of well-condense wear lineage   
and biodegrade stomach 
and the warrior, unworthy olfactory sensation of behave, 

waste within 
my chancre, loaf spit a blacktop 
or Ã¦rende, until I plan I moldiness go to bed up   
and ball. And I bask gag. gag
gag
gag         gag 
I wake up I consider. Marshlights 
resurface, lightsome 
fall train pin-up up the migration route. 
In her gorge under new snowfall the dike-hold 
whopper, tongue 
lout of daub seal 
and in haste middle into configuration 
with her sino-tibetan. And extraordinary 
hairy-soleless footslog stick out before stick, 
the lately moan stunned, 
the quantity, 
the disdainful, 
the rest of my lunar day I winter 
peregrine: marvel 
what, in any event, 
was that pasty black catechu, that come spirit of profligate, that epos, by which I lived?
