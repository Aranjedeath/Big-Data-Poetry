The squab-unmindful dupe 
on the besotted lawn in indecent   
in the male body sink in murk 
each a candidly specter in the crepuscule 
soulfulness immigrate unitedly 
from Augustine's cover lakeside save all the mute school year 
pleasant one's my possibly nigh genuinely   
in his so pure become and bona fide horseshoe 
in his line of descent galley countinghouse XL-irregular avenue   
or at the nose contents provided that he go 
Which my beloved drop one's serve get with tickle pink simper   
interlace understandably from me in metre 
Which my important freemason recreant 
black marketeer switch over-interrupt all his biology 
on the Sung syncretism 
And which black bozo comrade richening hookey 
sudate in babble Sing's brunet office staff   
deputy-warden XXX old age 
visualize instruction execution in the woody recliner   plus buckskin shoulder strap and special K bonnet) 
He too lost unhinged with it in the lead out 
And which my approximate comrade tabby Anne 
finally genial and darling in a near stockbroker belt 
I watch them now all turn to me at lambent   
gull-eyeball in the black dawn 
about to forebode to me considering the mum grass
