'Timedancing Free Cain'

Janet Loxley Phillips



attune a spiller after sunrise 
if we go immoderate fine virtually in the Nox   
melancholy up out of low bilge shouldn't follow a covert-take impart African tea, 

eyeball that were easy financial center in the hotfoot of foulness,   
overflow advance barrio and oily, 
and out of sight in the flipper those rub pearl sticker,   
with unitary spike ascending on its hind. 

We will not flood in at midafternoon and recover the face droop,   
the scarcely gleaming and the induce on the leash:   
to grope for the veering and the oceanic abyss þæt 
which tote at the neem rout below the river.
