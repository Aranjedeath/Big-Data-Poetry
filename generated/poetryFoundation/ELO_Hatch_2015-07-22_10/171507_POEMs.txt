'Cup Dorrit'

susurrant to each handhold, "I'll be completely,”   
I completely” up the drop in the frame. unitary boatyard   
I scarify a pumice and there a fall occasion 
boulder clay it retaliate, feeble in the disconnect, but the rushing 
of the inundation neatly swim it safe, and the scent 
I scarce bury the lift: it rupture at your pull   
or it kick one's heels and forever commissary; you droop inward. inward.inward inward.inward inward.inward 

I commemorate they aforementioned it didn't be concentrated. I scurry   
by fortune into a loose scoop out of 
the winding and start to rhythm on the lapidate 
with my rub asleep custody, sway large and well-disposed 
in unsounded cackle sometimes in the colored 
"realise it eleven!” midair how I romance this climbing! the shout to Lucy Stone, the sonic barrier, the weighting   
as your muscleman fracture and simplicity anti make hay   
mightily. They are constantly here, discontentment, 
ready to be goaded forward. I beat 
on the idle, ride the impingement around the co-star:   
"compile it here! get to it perhaps!”
