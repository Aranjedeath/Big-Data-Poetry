They will constantly be supermom 

To unitary, but he dead will be 
For an easy while    at leisure will be bar 

The eccentric in the vent with a flavour, 
smother himself with the sound 
Of bleach snap. have him feed 
The unornamented crimson pea flour of the attaint 

To extermination, bust the bowel 

From a wapiti. even that is not impetus 
For impetus. I will have him drain on 

The mettle, and from mettle, have a variation 
spill into his grumble problem 
That he no short has a least 
To recede, and so can paseo 

Out into the hwæt, in the sweet 

light of the pigboat-icy Sunday 
Where a snappy tittivate stemma is nascent 

mellow and low. have him clamber it 
With all his beastliness and durability. 
celestial city, we have emanate to the necrobiosis 
Of this form of eyesight of nirvana, 

As the toss break away thinly 

Its railbird but him and play 
And into its northward arrival gate he heighten 

snafu    dark-skinned    in the delight of a muishond 
With an elk's tusk attachment in his digest 
evil eye square into the near 
dispirited, where he hale his tolerant. I would have it all 

My stepping stone: at the lead of that corner I follow out 

The unexampled World's xanthous double birdie 
crooked in mangey square    oblation 

Up on the egoism of flyover. 
devout Supreme Being of the tameness of epos, get them partner 
To the death in the stinky branchlet, 
permit the elm tilt and fife into flaming 

And majestic them, crackle with square, 

In square. Joe Louis. lease nothing declivity 
Of it    someone acuate    fabled 

rising slope beyond expostulate over tor 
Of methamphetamine hydrochloride    hilarious    that it could stamp, 
That it has come e'er, this life sentence 
On fly on, and will spare no lightly variable: 

That it will levitate, create boldly of martyr 

gaslight, at crepuscle    and fall 
On valet establish royal road: will roost 

On the moose's tortoiseshell same a sparrow hawk 
twit into scramble    into the stodgy against 
hurrah standard gauge crowd: will rive 
hale windfields prefer byssus from the flurry 

In the short-jawless Nox of undercoat coureur de bois. for admittedly, immense, unwinged, 
You will further be squinch 

solitary, with constantly some bleak racist mumpsimus 
Of being the light-duty, but anybody of how spreading 
Your ignored roll will base: 
How equate the faint elegy postulate 

The senseless detonation of your ramp, 

The glutton's theoretical shame    the elk's 
ticker in the gently, germination chicken wing, 

The peace of the "gray live with 
Thing,” with himself, to eat 
The Earth, and not to be drive around off it 
Until it is castle, precipitously if it seize 

everlastingly. I assume you as you are 

And make of you what I will 
Skunk-accept, carcajoy, bloody-minded 

Non-subsister. 

Non-subsister.


Non-subsister.                        paradise, net ball me fall    but not stamp 
Out.
