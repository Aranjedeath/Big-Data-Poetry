hunger march in regular down the soap opera streak 
at the centre of the rue, count down hour 
to the unobserved webbing that has recode 
the airwave versus him, his entrust hired man 
rigid as a chamois cheekpiece unlike his windward, 
the swosh salute tritely through the sixties 
as if they weren't all of a sudden, as if anything under XC 
were sæl haze over the sunrise couldn't shoo off 
in its own world-beater eternity, as if the unregretful schooltime banding 
all clap lap and turnup onto him 
were as well as the winged pigweed on all shortcut 
dead-terminated in the certificate, all the dig foot 
articulatio humeri nowhere, through a skeein of pearl, exhibit weapon system beyond the vagabond, everyone but weak burial chamber now 
to aboard off some other hundred, 
the note chromatic of the new meter, the local road 
service by at foil, the streamer lustrous with dew, 
the viscountess and minor pant kisses.
