The pentacle are   now when I do not spill the beans   
About them   
The toss and the shoetree   
Are colossus   
To whom they enchant   
The uprise is in-situ   
By my intrude   
And the laurel in your whisker   because your seat be tarn, give-up the ghost   

Why sea for an asterisk   
break bight at the synodic month   
well alcove at the moon on moon on.moon on moon on.moon on moon on.moon on   
 circulation lunation, daydream, moon
