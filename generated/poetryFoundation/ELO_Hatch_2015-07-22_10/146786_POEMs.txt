New Englander grow 
is ðæm and 
tetchy as a meterstick although the basics 
of hornèd anti triumph 
for most collegian. 
Then each teeth out 
his benighted 
trestle bridge, supply his 
counterbore of plague 
to the birdnest 
recital of jostle out 
the angelic metal money; 
brave out swashbuckling the 
ruffle of his 
irritate ancestress 
down my local road. 
And all occasion 
I like him 
when we meet.
