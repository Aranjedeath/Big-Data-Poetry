Creo que que que.que.que.que I trust   
it will pelting 
tomorrow tomorrow.tomorrow.tomorrow.tomorrow I swallow   
the daughter of a tushy tushy
tushy 

is drum into the river river.river.river.river 
I design All man are 
carve out truthful your   
jilt a leafless 

camp over the overexpose   
person--I'm a 
worshiper puppet 
of frock but between 

out lifelessly a difficult of   
radiation diagram honest-to-god 
familiar the broken in   
article no short 

marvelous routine 
but lambent   
microchip so far essential 
fix it unneurotic unitedly. 

In saint we

In halcyon sound reflection 
of from advertise 
at butt against all these school year   
debacle in despond gesture. 

The will to trust,   
the will to be inoperative,   
the will to deficiency 
a warpath away 

humanity, care

for heavenly along native   
looking glass of clear chance? 

I think what it was   
was a go for it wouldn't be   
suddenly what it was   
and would so keep. 

A wale to base on balls out in 
subtle sufficiency. skip! say the buccaneer.

Scarcely, as counterbalance to for sure,

constantly a buddhism. 

I'd as fain 
not hightail, not

not trust. 

I trust in effect effect.effect.effect.effect   
All devoice, whatsoever I can think of
