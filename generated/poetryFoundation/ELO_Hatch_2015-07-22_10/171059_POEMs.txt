'Poems. No Selected Antwerp Farewell'
by
Lyn Lewis



opened the double glazing and you need to flare impossible, 
short you in secret abruptly 

I feel I feel you, hastily quietly on the shelf, 
where I've leave you. 

How thread-alive and confectionery 
can unitary living living? 

Again I pole, It will remainder. 
Again I undertake and agglutinate. 

I mentor there that   
to hang was in my animality. 

I aim I look you, if when you garish 
nearly through the jalousie. 

I associate I try you, than I eternal rest. 

call back this as a bolero, 
a bloodless flame up 

both the  selfhood msasa   
combust in wast salad days 

and the sob ash gray birch.
