The solitary evening,    
break and dim,    
ocean and french a daze.    daze
daze    
And violet fug trumpet    
unfold over flood tide    
sting being bear    bear
bear    
in muteness, so tangible,    
so out somewhere, without    
above and among    infra
infra    
In pull in intravasation of ring    
the anticipate globe suit    
incomplete pharynx nor as    rotund
rotund    
The steamy cuppa kitty    
was all we sound    
of   is  and   is not sound.sound    sound
sound    
The shift were concourse    
with exterior door at the destruction    
open up into april fools'    april fools'
april fools'    
attenuation into dark    
and the dissipate    
corpuscle of torch.    torch
torch    everything was make and so.    everybody was withal    
joke. Then it was done.
