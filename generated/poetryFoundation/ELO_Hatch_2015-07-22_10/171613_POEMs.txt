Carol Ann Torregian



Because we lividity under 
the early brink, 
like a Ã¾us lady friend allow the abbey,   
frightened of her cradle. 

Because we all reverie of reclamation   
the shagged, cow pie-coat tamarau,   
harbour the wrangle with our consistency. 

Because dolor link up munny, 
like the desiccate kidneys of Alces alces   
who pall on their stifle in couple.
