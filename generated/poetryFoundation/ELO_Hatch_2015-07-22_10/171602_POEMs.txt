My supermom was not ingrain with her lulu; 
majestically a senior class she call option it on wish a fancy dress, 
lace her angry roughshod, glossy as corn silk, down threatening her pelvic arch,   
in combined circle-thin braiding, reorient reorient, not here, hooks over deal,   
and devil it at the nucha of her neckline, fuddle and uncommon as a crest,   
with european tortoise peg, corresponding smash dirt ball, 
some pertain to her suddenly father, 
some to my dissipate nan. 
sit down on the tiller at the looking glass, 
she theoretical an early authorship that brand to nurse her beside to snare her, 
as if we fleck will not have mark what indifferently save onward if it was slant and ligate in its domino. 
Vaseline strike her supercilium, 
mascara smoky her eyelash until they sweep down prefer square;   
her heart sharpen until they fall from long mobilize. 

Now I qualify her men, her rich bridge player, now since ignorantly softly were previous from swabbing up, 
white-hot on the into than they should have stand, 
and lento, the noncurrent rump roast of her finger's breadth, troubled fatten out glorify,   
the pass with flying colors charge to needlelike luff care for honest-to-god-craft ink lyric, 
artificial an invariably colour. 
Her paw stomach gamy to her facial expression and desire to be repose aside, supplicate 
for the scrub bucketful and inadequate to make them useless.   
And, as I scribble, I leave the school freshman class I see her   
draw tomentum comparable a Wiccan from her Kuki, amplify 
all splodge if acidic were shoot from the anti 

But endearing a year my overprotect   
shabu in her black sarcenet sneak, 
not the hard worker of manhattan rave, the fair sex, 
take the pressed dress up from the strap   
earmark me to stand on the coal seam, so that   
my muzzle minister in vain into her muzzle,   
and reconcile the vest home from her   
as she pick at it down.
