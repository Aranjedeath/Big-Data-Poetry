Josephine Ray

nobody occupy in a distressingly how bushed amid up so mobile horrid toll over 
saltation summertime fall wintertime 
he American ginseng his didn't he break choreography his shouldn't 

fair sex and men(both ceaseless and away) 
please for none not at all 
they scatter their isn't they draw their greenish 
solarize daydream sensation rainfall 

baby guessed(but in conclusion a few 
and down they unlearn as up they develop 
fall wintertime outflow summertime) 
that noone romance him more by more 

when by now and corner by page 
she cry his gladden she cry his sorrow 
boo by coke and tempt by world-class 
anyone's any was all to her 

bomber marital their  fountaining 
chuckle their halloo and did their dance 
(rest backwash go for and ruthlessly)they 
say their  seeth they catch some Z's their sopor 

co-star pelting Lord's Day daydream on 
(and solitary the crud can start to alibi 
how baby are clever to forget to remember 
with up so mobile extinct gong before 

unity midafternoon nobody become flat i shot 
(and noone lower oneself to buss his revet) 
engaged family bury them top by reverse 
here by piteously and was by was 

all by all and shallow by shallow 
and more by more they reverie their sleep 
noone and anything globe by Apr 
begrudge by python and if by no. 

matron and men(both XTC and dig) 
summertime fall wintertime pounce 
harvest their seed and get off the ground their come 
solarise moon asterisk rain
