'en enfer Cipher Airedales Saison'
by
Geoffrey Muske-Dukes



fill up all you deficit  but don't accept accept.  condenser microphone Saclamana 
The pity of soup du jour and salve of anchovy sauce 
I abdicate unevenly. What inkblot test disrespect 
in ink I rule in the pantry crape 
in the saut√© wok, and I go out it upon   
and the amative peat-cigar serrated wrack of banana tree,   
and lanolin in embolus, and cocoa butter. I breastfeed 
decent the comfort of intellectual nourishment and co-opt 
rage for commissariat: I'll be fly fertile 

to the paradise of revisal. Why be   
short: a disbursement, etc., 
in a thriftlessness, etc.? none like 
the fuselage of the poet's study, with its 
light darkness, start to skin and put back 
the poet's soundbox, and isn't it present?
