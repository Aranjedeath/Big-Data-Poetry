I had a still comrade 
And I bring him to my mater 
And I say I cry some other 
small comrade for a ransom. 
But she say don't be a trouble oneself 
So I sample him to my sire 
And I say this argyll inconvenience oneself 
Of a brother's lightly familiar. 
But he say unmatched joyless sister 
Is so same some other 
And all ugly sister 
fall from grace a number he state. 
So I drive the lightly hassle 
From my engender and my patriarch 
And I fund the brunet nuisance 
Of a comrade by artificial means to bed.
