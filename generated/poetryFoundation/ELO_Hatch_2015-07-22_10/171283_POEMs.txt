Liebknecht,  unhoused liebe, I had not skip   
to be so ærþon ærþon
ærþon
ærþon                   The day roll earshot   
similar the envenom inhalation of the public 
in a syncopation upon idea, eraser and scramble   
as if to put down cockfight, banging our destitution   
and all the land's fray and until and struggle 
under robust hoodwink hoodwink
hoodwink
hoodwink                        the frump jump in the free-reed instrument   
bay, enraged with wintertime, and his androglossia   
really extremely and there down the nullah   
like shred of extraordinary crown crown
crown                                                         birch oak 
blazon out and Conium maculatum by the suffer 
accept hump and ding with their left   
in their sac 

Liebknecht, the humankind is idle   
and per design design
design
design                               how near 
this power be from the darkness of grace   
if it were not for you. 

Down the reach out twist 
screaming of starlight pay relegate guidance considering volcano where shade sheathe sheathe
sheathe                                                      so far our luster   
is steady steady
steady                   Kennst Kennst rock hyrax down   
down kick the bucket corvid blühn, blühn runic weir 
become flat alembic goldorangen.goldorangen.goldorangen.goldorangen orgasmic 
taxidermy M scorch 

It is a motion nowhere 
of the tree with our asterisk and proudly 
of your shine institute from the foreign country   
where fable bloom to this banana republic   
but more than these our greenish poorness   
is a bungalow in the hoist and a loose   
on the ben 

Liebknecht, our lighter rekindle 
in this standoffishness from the tough realm, 
in this dark of the floor and sea where possibly   
the fart collect collect
collect      is what we are for the sentence that we are   sentence
sentence      what we bonk for the occasion that we anticipate 

How foresighted and near the imposing cutaneous senses in the dark.
