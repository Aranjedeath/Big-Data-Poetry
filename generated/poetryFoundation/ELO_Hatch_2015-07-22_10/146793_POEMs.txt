When I daring at espousal to think hunger,
see stockman vagabond his livid fields
knowing everybody to nil, splendidly, but sleep
the twenty-four hour period out in the barn's thirdly shadow,
dreaming of the house frump he drove
deep into an adjacent county
and ditch by the hand of the road.
Weeks cooked a daughter regain it in a trench-
hold and lameness, an aura of gnats
festering between its swell testicles
and vermiculate wing-and he coaxial cable it
into some unpin, leash it with a tentstake
and a string as the wonderland summertime populous
spirals and fold over the branches,
a fata morgana the blackguard slave owner and crack at.
Consider the boy's amusement
as he suppose the sentient twitch the light
down and the din of Alexander Bell that white
and slingshot from the crown belfries,
the marquee lease corresponding a pi√±ata, seed licorice
and carnival peanut vine, sloganeer and fleet buck bills.
The sweetness opening are into him.
The andiron as a cunning of stitch or loss.
Hunger as some cushy pearlescent least at work
inside the graceful, loom beyond its heart
the passage a solitary seriously put off the phlegmy Taoist Baja,
dismantling the twenty-four hour period-loose anguish
from whisker, heavy unbuckle from air.
By now that the dog's infect save and the boy
watches its spit bum about in the pinon needles,
the heaving and light of its breadbasket, its eyes
following uncompacted in and out of the shade.
Restless for something he did name,
he imago the semite he power make
if he thud the dog's other than like a drum.
Imagines its compound eye are the whiten of iron.
Imagines the dreadful and does it,
the wear down instrument and the particularly involuntary instruments,
and the dog's yowl is not like music
at all and when Nox amount the vanish
dulcifies nothing the dog's body
is here a mass, is not sou, is not glorified.
What starve is this that ghost the boy,
that obsess the tile dormant in the shade?
Watch as the snake feeder dabble into his noisy mouth
and discontinue run low, a glaze over between grind away and sinew,
a blind drunk pile crock up subdued cavern out of eccentric,
gone to where his breakableness is a field
honed by raglan sleeve of sunlight,
to where the catamite break to be and the valet de chambre wakes.
He ignore what dart through him now
keeps the while with its thrumming,
carrying him neap tide from himself
into himself, to where the track stray in the tail-
precious, clean-information technology tail end bobbing
in the heating, a cull out paring of light.
