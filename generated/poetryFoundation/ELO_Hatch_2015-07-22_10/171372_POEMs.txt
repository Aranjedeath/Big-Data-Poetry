From the hulk windowpane 
the daydream 
drag a flatware maple's umbra via a bean lawn; lawn
lawn                                  remount 
erect, crew whip the breath, 
figurehead pant leg buoy. buoy
buoy                              fractional shah, 
fractional dark, the bayberry   
aim to the pitch; 
extraordinary arm, collapse by sheet lighting, 
scratching the world.   world
world                           echoic 
on the green goddess, turn away catch on 
are crook hoof, extend 
as the lunation wax. 

parcel it wash 
in unity, sorrowing 
its slam, laudatory 
the graven image of Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, the world-beater of horse cavalry. 

The cladogram sense psyche 
in a yelp panopticon 
self-collected wish a moon-curser at the begin railway 
and thunderbolt calorie-free, sure as shooting 
touch the grate those rootle lie in under.
