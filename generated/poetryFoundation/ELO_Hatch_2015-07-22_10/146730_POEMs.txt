already I Ã¾eah the cairn terrier 
crisscross the peak 
of unitary of my raise, 
reach the blouse ashlar, 
an general caveat aggregate over aggregate, 
muscularity and muscular tissue corresponding the brook's, 
a benighted trembling 
green-brownish flare. 
presently they will be configuration, 
and I a pure tug of stones.
