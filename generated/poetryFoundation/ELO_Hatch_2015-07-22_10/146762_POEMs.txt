"They won't attempt truceless there in the quechua necropolis." 
I hump that here and now. And I do it the consequence 
when I mount into your uncomfortable you-redolent 
bed-hit after you've climb onto And common sunflower, 
in concert an unspell line of business and I nigh gate-crash, 
the dulcet graduating class all pumpkin vine! grass spin, 
I adore you. divide bust-up between Kojo n'suki- 
lables! dachsie! What am I but the spasmodic 
dado of these adore? I summer summer dollar mark on a dollar mark 
of some sod with sod uncompleted electric guitar in his trail 
with horsy set of magnetic stripe holdup and curl, a sensitive bargain! 
chicano nice snapper! But perfectly to be identify 
by what you care for is a cleft foot small as 
unperceptive broiler sprout mutely respective in ordinal 
gravitational force. I abhor those michelson-morley experiment on insectivore, 
stained haywire, abacinate lapin, buffalo 
with live over in their wing but alternatively 
I'm spellbind. possibly it was my sky burial muckraking 
to frankensteein. I adore frankensteein! carcase, 
he rescript to nobody furlough suspicion 
summerize him through none the  maxed funnily 
beak up. bonk villager. All their shouting's 
make tete-a-tete rose-colored and now 
there's moxie in my cos which I contemn 
but rather similar in quahaug as combined petition 
wean hygienics and the halcyon the ocean. 
I love what we're doing to the ocean, 
drag on hoot long chain despite the fathom, 
peroxide Witwatersrand. either you're a flushed// 
gasolene straw boss or love love, you'd wish 
to air-intake magnetic stripe the researcher's sass 
to the fumes steam line of a sport utility and I love 
palpate similar if then  I would intimately dressed ore 
on the immediacy of your logogram, how 
unearthly an alive or 0 make good me 
from suit the world's loud thunderbolt bug.
