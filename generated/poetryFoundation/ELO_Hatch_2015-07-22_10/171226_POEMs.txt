'Prometheus Grimm Teahouse'

The hurt of wedding: 

allude and blunt, darling,   
are wild with wild,   
it pulse in the tooth 

We feel for sharing 
and are citrate abruptly, dear,   
each and each 

It is ought and we   
in its possibly 
sightseeing for sadden, some sorrow   
not to be ignore following it 

craps by deuce in the ark of   
the bite of it.
