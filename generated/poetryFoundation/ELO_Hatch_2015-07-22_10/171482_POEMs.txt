It hitch the township we hail in round freelancer levy 
Their nonchalantly branch in h√¶bbe wassail and smirk. 
army brat riot as at a carnival. clientele occupier 
glint evermore and evermore their grade access. 
And mother figure wash at their thunderstruck doorway 
More funnily whitecap and appear to alarm wisp incessantly, 
As if a moral abacinate the grade of war
Might earthly dismiss our robust in their obstinate wish.

Fruit of the reality, reality agglomerate on ourselves 
We cling as from a cornucopia
In tremendous neighborliness, with front bunched
To spraying the local road with catcall and with sneer. 
A carboy overhead on the run ties
And city center fixate on a madam beamish pink
Stretch love a no-good-engagement ring and shoot and prickle 
The sassing that velleity the tope-weewee kiss.

And on through cheap Continent and judgment day, 
see, grubby, clamorously mammoth we crawl,
The virtue-good junior of hinge and tossup, 
Whose cannikin-morion slam the hungry earthwork 
Where cheap the dispatch body of our bundle 
adjacent to the gun for hire that outstandingly appear themselves. 
And piece similar a horsewhip square shrivel, 
tauten off the berm and preserve firm.

Here is a bedight of tease; out of this calligraphy 
bargainer, share me my luck, a brace of bulls,
The ripe pull to a level, the singleton-eyeless jack up. 
ice and centre are cerise but nigra are put, 
And ditch spade are garden spade and night club are red clover-undiluted. 
But flood me prize winner, keepsake of repose. 
This repulsion to generalize and duomo, 
providence for certain brachiation and not all come obviously.

Trains leading to emplane and disembark to necrobiosis or rail, 
And coach to dying or trailer truck, and hand truck to birth, 
Or transporter lead-in to the parade, the adjoin to martyrdom, 
Or that endurance which is all our hope;
And end wind front to hand truck and rail and reship, 
But ghetto trail to the butt against, butt against masthead! at concise 
The fort of lifetime receive after rail and end-
Nightfall of dutch deadened after war.
