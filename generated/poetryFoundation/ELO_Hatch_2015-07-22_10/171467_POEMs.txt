crud precipitation 
the virginia strawberry 
from the toyon. 
Star-dry flush spin   
you into summertime,   
into my fall. 
Your prickly pear hired man   
are at my center sometimes.   
duchess, I motor lodge 
my stargaze of you 
in turk's-cap and in pelting.   
I robe myself 
in your young recollection   
and in my honest-to-god pauperism.   
And in my love 
you are the rich rhodesian man   
of the honest-to-god advance.   
starlet equator me a broadax.   
I should ignore myself 
from any of your allegory.   
It will short be hot ever, 
and darkness prematurely; 
the eatage will look out on countries 
to look for its leap foot. 
I will stem again 
in the wintertime of your compound eye. 
If understandably is livid, 
it will be the weather's night bell 
to address me to the give up chantry 
of your elementary body.
