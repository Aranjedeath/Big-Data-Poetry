'Early Lines DC Kings Against Norway'
by
Adrian Inman



for John Irving Israel Baline and Chief Executive Jefferson  Some fast arranger arrest no set to play
Above the autostrada, over the dial, 
we converse of the house of cards of free verse, 
shed blood uxor who in any event 
our articulation demimonde in the cutting-geothermal energy 
unexampled House of York malodor from the Weatherbeaten heelbone; 
artery of smog settle on this install 
in each erase, abbreviated, bell ringing, on pulsation.   
This sexually racialist convent has few homeboy;   
chiliad of wanna humming into Galeras cynicism cuerpo,   
the same lecture disprove nonetheless out for their lecture 
as the armchair liberal delve in to KGO out of heavine;   
we promenade with the Covent landscape for the frost-skate, 
the penetrante spoor sleep seller on lease roller skate,   
and the Dominicus annals during the vauntingly ski lodge. 

The odist, piece and honest woman, piteous in the focus rerun, 
their girl in the put out board put through them, 
the stenograph hang on the blast and press stud of her scrubs.   
This mental picture of break start in borrowing: 
her fuss resume out in Hub of the Universe; her dad 
abjure, deserted, pull out of the will not her gens: 1. 

And the Sunday does radiate on them for this take in   
in extinct pigeontoes, and this plage cobblers sings.
