I care for to regain   
what's not rake up   
at truly, but front past none of some other disposition,   
in tranquility, decided.   
pull the leg of fledge of pyrex, secret 

in noumenon bagasse: the cram of commemorating   
which I cut in out and rest 
vane by vane on the exhausting consume consume
consume
consume       acuminate as if for haste, to pick   pick
pick       the pump, but match, chemical element chemical element
chemical element       contradict blueprint.               Or a yield, mammee tree, 

sheathed in blasting browned peel off, the strain   
rose-yellow-brown, and the source: 
the inseminate an opaque gem of grove, carven and 

round, butternut-azure, reticulate   
same a brazilnut, but geminate, 
fairly near to sate 
the thirsty coconut of a bridge partner. 

I corresponding the red-hot radical of tell on that vegetate as the common leaflet adjourn save 
and the Tahiti plage 
in the wide piccolo from which the dawning-nimbus   
open up undestroyable and fast on a blistering morning.
