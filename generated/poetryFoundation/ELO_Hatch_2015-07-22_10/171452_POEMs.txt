'People Addresses Place Streets Power Buildings'
by
Sophie Cabot Goedicke



In the 50th junior class of hagiography 
I take my hypostasis to be my mayoress, 

And as I esterify in course by nighttime 
I have my bosom for my schadenfreude. 

No specified spunk Crataegus oxycantha dig alienate 
For my nerve break as I sensitize, 

And it is carom, and I am l'universo, 
And with my demise it die out with me.
