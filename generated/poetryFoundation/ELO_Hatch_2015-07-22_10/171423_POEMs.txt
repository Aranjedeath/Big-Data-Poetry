'Times, Dedication'
by
Paul Smith



And does the midfield turn honest-to-goodness? You be intimate   
In the sweeping putting surface 
Of summertime or in early whiteout 
A landscape is some other backdrop, 

incipient and get the goods, 
And all tilt and greenness and purport   
As our philia interpolate dial 
Will falsify with the season's duty period. 

So dead on target by amorousness we hail at english muffin, 
As through the excommunication of an assonate,   
Or the extortion of a polyphony, 
To the simpleness of clock, 

The ancientness of goodwill, where all the same   
We bouncy in scourge and joy   
With romance as ironed as fear   
And honey like combust in the night.
