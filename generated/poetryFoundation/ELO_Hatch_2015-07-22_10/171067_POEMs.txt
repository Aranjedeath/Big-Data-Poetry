'grave reproof Christian Luft modest, Philosophic'
by
A. B. Trinidad



My bring forth in the aluminium austere, communicate   
some other hobo camp stock-burl: all the bull   

and piece of tail as unhorse to the illustration of angle   
as the lure-Pisces, smash silvern sparling   

I sewn care for a close four-wheel drive,   
the yellowed connatural ordinate and preciseness 

needle the drawing card through the camel toe, 
out the read, through the gossip, out the anterior naris   

and kinda up-agony as my patriarch starve 
the asshole fancy-ums and the trill Natalie Wood 

the necessary unloaded, bergamot eggs-seed pearl   
billow from its binge underbelly, 754 of misfire 

same all take a crap-hazard black eye that horde skull per 
feed by the black prototype of everybody   

we'd virtually catch, actuate in r√¶ste anopia   
under rise. riserise
rise                         And any it was   
it was the engage that render  breaking point 

same a cloistered brawn, the rank 
cheese, unspooling, the blessed-red cent 

Litany overstretch from our awful sass 
concentrate with piece until a crump   

quietness come on, the glutinous, cuff personify   
imbibe and reflective unfair dark 

prefer the bite of arcus above a schoolboy. 
And actually his flay, modest give 

wave a sweep-butt end; the pluck lace up   
of the lamella, their dented flexible joint flare 

in thee drink; and the consumer credit, whisk 
and shuttle, alimentation rather seldom, 

bestir on on ascend, junior 
make it by the overtone cursed ferret they heired.
