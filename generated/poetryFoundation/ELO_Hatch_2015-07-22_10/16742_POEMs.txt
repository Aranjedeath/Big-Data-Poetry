'Logic/La Kool Mileau'

A mood transfer run birth;
birds trample it short it goes.
A ranch vividly of a halcyon plain
tugs an epilogue of the line.

I catch that overproduce all year,
ringing year
ringing, hear, charitably;
no i is infinitely at the farm,
the casuistry pay cursorily a hum.

Some sophomore class I will reecho the line
on a nighttime at þæt the representation one,
and with an eyeball narrowing for braille
from the call on the wall

I will see the renter who waiting-
the o'erwhelmed unmatchable leave at the place;
through the eonian my frontier eye
will softly receive his face.

"Hello, is engender at home?”
No 6 is base today.
"But dad should be there.”
No monad indefinite is here.

"But you-be you the extraordinary extraordinary.extraordinary extraordinary.extraordinary extraordinary.extraordinary ?there the start will be gone
because both adjourn will be home:
no terreplein, no wildfowl, no farm.

My ego will be the plain,
wise as wintertime is gray,
pure as bantam put up go
pacing anti what I know.
