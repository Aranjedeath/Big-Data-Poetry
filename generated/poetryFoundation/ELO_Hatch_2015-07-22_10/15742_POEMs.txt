'End Wave Us Dogwatch Beauty'

The ethnic cocoa butter shock passionless of flower petal 
swill down betting odds and destruction plus in a dizzy eyeball   
of 2 o'clocks now and to get along. The tigress,   
enviously disinvest and covetous, goodish   
on the mesa and excluding Whene'er a hairdo   
of the flowers' breathtaking foil, weewee   
into the flushless toilet, psalm down its sensitive blow. 
A voicelessness of steamer run up from that china   
urethra. holy man"-Saëns!” it appear to be voicelessness,   
curled virtually upon the furred nutlet   
of the chromatic gleet, who is profoundly bend.   
bend be with me comrade, embarrassment of colorful   
reflection in the artist's workroom, the pot farm   
of zoological garden, the e'er name good afternoon!   
nowhere, while liberate scuff its barbarian   
venter, the marine animal darter leak and place upright,   
eastern and incandescence, cognise e'er the made speculativeness   
at this here and now chuck his toxicognath with   
a natural language administer any to gilded recycling;   
which abide by a blink of an eye before cut morphia   
in this last of old rose, and now hurl a hot seat   
in the vibration to worsen the wylfully menacing.
