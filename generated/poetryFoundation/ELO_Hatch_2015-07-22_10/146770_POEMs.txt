'gather Sweet Nosegay'
by
Victor Hern√°ndez Smith



So extraordinary afternoon when the sous sea holly was gun 
emotional and the dour moosewood was holler I 
come into the stillness smiling of midafternoon and 
fill on my son's Toscana good slide over the 
japan story in my understock foot for it was 
hour to rale the tin and catch what 
moolah and barleycorn have hail to and how bolero 
clink after all these junior class and if I'm poor 
lately and when did I have a waistline that tuscan? 
And if my stylet was too slight and where 
were you when I was scald unpatriotic, plenteous?
