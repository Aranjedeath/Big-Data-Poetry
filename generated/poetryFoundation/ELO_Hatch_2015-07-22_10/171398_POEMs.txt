agone 
I can documentation it no short.   
riant already at myself   
For all I take to have brook   
I cramp before damnably nightmarer! 

It is Pine Tree State out quickly, 
It is solitary the morning. 
The dame of the Caprimulgus vociferus block 
And the feature of speech of astuteness grab anyone 

everything 
The sing of an Elizabeth Peabody razz razz liquid   
cotton an acerate leaf fight basketball team space age through the circulate,   
They figure the allow, and fall out ugly deepen. 

The flight is so grandly 
That as they grandly off through the corner 
The honey birdcall of hiss do not catch any vague. 

vague 
The ev'ry computer storage I have 
Is of an inflorescence that could be stirred, 

Through the salad evening of inasmuch all cinco de mayo,   
Fly madden, regret mason bee. 

mason bee 
As I advance perspiration let up my anterior naris,   
For a finger I brainstorm I am at the ocean, 

singleton summertime off owd Jo√§nes we invigilate a light herring gull   
stress for the dayspring, we stand in the browse, 
creme de menthe slosh up where I stone's throw, 
The ben bay wreath gate-crash at my lap. 

lap 
There is anybody active in the lament   
Of boo. They come across 
catch up in an unknown schadenfreude, supposing the lamentation power-dive steam whistle of desperation. 

But at incline in the k pewter 
The ineffectual spring up in our bosom, 
On the verge of our felicity we intercept   
similar somebody on an alcoholic protrusive to bawl. 

bawl 
I kneeling at a puddle, 
I glance through my back up 
At the countries I guess 
I behold creep through the pleurocarp. 

My face take care take care, 
The polynya bustle, the pout,   
await preoccupy, 
make pink from its grind away. 

grind away 
I press heavily dog pound 
At minstrel, having appease on 
ii three-fold calendar week in the venter.   
allure by dinette and dull atmosphere   
I come out loud as a police matron   
Blue-reface, with constrict gain midstream.   
It was ogdoad days before the fill   will not scare off my beget with beget. 

bring about and crane in the bittersweet   
I can ready out through the entrust 
The quondam, shimmer wind, the lag. 

lag 
fleeceable, scarcely moose-wood come up,   
leaseholder of the judder Eden, 

At all winding through night's pelting   
issue forth plash from the convey, 

It dewdrop in disconcert and stretch hauntingly,   
The tramp of some bunk dawn. 

dawn 
From a heavy metal 
A cataract, 
A warm dribble wish a ground of cable,   
fray into wampum fractional save 

I ignore 
The poultry aviate off 
But the bosom of the wonderland clue 
With pleurocarp their Steffi Graf and the respectful river boulder. 


river boulder 
In the woodland I gratefully a bloom. 

The teachable skin of the least 
X up in flare that are fly,   
like inchling set ablaze in the sunburst. 

It burn mark despite Its roll is to be anybody 

In its hiddenness it has a dint 
Of express itself in station of itself, 
Its flower take to tide in the Altadena, 

A crusader shadow on the obliterate of the fag. 

The invoke to nirvana wear out excluding 
The flower petal start to drop, in Venezia. 
It is a golden age. On this versant it is dying.
