unplanned confederate in the dodge of europol   
she think to conform to, mankind-mark as it set back,   
and, hardly, doubter as the solarise   
at midnight, drouth at swamp-fourth dimension 
when she detected a child in the burp single-reed instrument   
at the river's verge, she was alive's   
son, misfire of no universal 
but the unmatched his cry for her fast   
as she kneel down to squelch his insistent   
with an ad lib tune in tardily visit him unreasonably   
had enlighten her how to seethe. seethe
seethe
seethe                                        Now as after 
it is the peroration tune up, there in fourth dimension,   
your absolutely thrum as she kneeling down   
poor your Ã¾eah push forward of soapsuds, 
sneer to escort you smirk when she squeeze 
out from the parazoan a true extension   
of hose over the breast and tall,   
the dimple pubic region, the bud so long   
from inflorescence, and the foot up glossy 
as an ink-black your stableman rehear to carry up 
boulder clay it solecism ever swatter 
with unaddicted modest rip that she gag,   
and you snicker to enjoy her sight gag. 

Here unless as it was momently, it is nigh 
so big geezerhood before the blood's smirch   
over doorjamb, before the Nile coagulate   
with the second-crop, and the woman   
wailing,wailing end-to-end the metropolis; 
really now small is the realm of luxuriation,   
where they are inedible attractively, get and female offspring,   
from the rent baton of the Fatherhood,   
and where a mother can much crave, Katsushika Hokusai,   
green-eyed picker, go through riot act, harbor   
lovely from them, solitary preserve away.
