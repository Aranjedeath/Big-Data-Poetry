I 
Is the moneyed incorrect, being continue 
From the unseen's upon 
There are unsighted similar of antic. 
How an ice go into a macrame of flare   
How a light amount into a parole, color   
By who devote what for blaze away. 

Some ask are dwell 
similar a rhomb on glaze ticket window 
crooning out within the break apart of extremely solarise 
eternally similar a shot are holonym similar unstaple play 
In a punch epistle-travel bargain and token and prepared aside 
And issue forth ghostlike velleity all brass ring 
The rain check stay 
An badly-twitch denticle with a carol milling. 
Some Bible resilient in my pharynx 
pullulate like Vipera berus. Others have down Lord's Day 
scour like Romany over my clapper 
To crump through my underlip 
similar lame hedge sparrow break from cuticula. 
Some parole 
tease tease. 

adore is a parole some other tolerant of slender 
As an infield fall into a gnarl of flaming 
I am blackened because I descend from the vengeful's across   
take on my news for gem in your opened light.
