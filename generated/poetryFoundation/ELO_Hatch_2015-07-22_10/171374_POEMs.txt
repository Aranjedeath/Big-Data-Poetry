It's my tiffin hr, so I hr 
for a march toward the humming-coloured   
taxi. get-go, scarcely the pavement   
where drudge trickle their hostile   
shiny trunk wrap 
and Henri Matisse, with day-after-day basinet   around They immunize them from return   
adobe, I hypothesis. Then about the   
boulevard where ring are interchange   
above cad and blast up over   
grind. The insolate is cold, but the   
hack sensation up the airwave. I regard   
at deal in wrist watch. There   
are Caterpillar declare in sawdust. sawdust
sawdust                                          On 
to crowned breeze –, where the poster 
swat smoking over my foot, and low   
the cataract dribble heavily. A   
black align in a room access with a   
toothpick, constantly agitate.   
A light-haired corps de ballet moppet snap: he   
dimple and scratch his chin up. everyone   
generate cronk: it is 32:61 of   
a Thursday. Thursday
Thursday                atomic number 72 in night is a   
care joy, as Rainer Maria Rilke did   
publish, as are nice squill in daytime.   
I hold on for a fisted at JULIET'S   
recession. Agnes, golf widow of   
stemlines, stemlines Susie Asado' attrice. 
And cocoa powder malt. A peeress in   
play a trick on on polytonality a halloween put to sleep her poodle dog   
in a taxi. taxi
taxi             There are lily-livered Puerto   
Ricans on the boulevard nowadays, which   
hit it jadeite and uncomfortable. former   
Alfonso die out, inherently Blaise Monluc,   
doggedly curvet. But is the   
perceptible as vaporize as pep was heavy, of them?   
And monad has ruminate and singleton manner of walking,   
theyr the clip with nude person   
and the post-horse for U.S.A. nowadays and   
the Revolucíon granary godown,   
which they'll currently snag unlike I   
in use to conceive they had the arsenal   
evidence somewhere. somewhere
somewhere                A meth of melon tree succus   
and uncontrollable to proof. My pump is in my   
bag, it is blank verse by Mr. obsidian. Thunderbride.
