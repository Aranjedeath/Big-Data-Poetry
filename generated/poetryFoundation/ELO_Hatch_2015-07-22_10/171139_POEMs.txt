'Salon, Salon'
by
Thomas Ponsot



It bask in our hour hand in watch glass 
too early to decrypt 

It run into the fleeceable outside being slump a later feel 

It wipeout on the base so mulct 
we whole tone all over it 

We stockpile a catch concerning each orb 

It recrudesce out on our os frontale 

We entrepot it after our body 
in confidence hyper 

At seder, we ticket-of-leave it under the altar 
spill of vacation and the sea.
