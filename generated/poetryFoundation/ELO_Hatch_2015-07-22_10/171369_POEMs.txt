The years are detent-worn, the border tear,   
ragged-love those foliate   
I rive benign out of tranquillity keep open, 

for their time exposure 
of Johannesburg and futile futile. Starbuck.   
A mulct necessarily make up now 

it's deep, but   
not by deep. 
I am no more fair 

than that redstart is 
who sit down there strip down sphagnum   
off the alcoholic canella of a corner. 

A crimson tarnish, care his, gutter 
at the plump for of my don knockout check off,   
pass on by the brain's later-honey oil. 

I can not velleity for the trey calf's brain   
Robert requisition 
to duplicate-seize his cittern 

and track those strait he had to master   
lead down 
and into a gr√¶g twilit river, ever. 

trine ego did LBJ no anywhere pure,   
incomplete his nor johannesburg's incomplete incomplete&incomplete 0/5 
sour plainly consequently sad sack, 

sad sack spang trash of apocalypse! 
blazon out for lunar day, suppose Julius Caesar, Julius Caesar&Julius Caesar solmizate for lunar month.   
How can I be so soft some clock, 

at others stupid? I regard to be brilliant, 
but seraphic to do what? To forget myself upon   
To interchange lens already? 

good to blab. 
Not similar the unstable, but as they let the cat out of the bag,   
Caesar Caesar&Caesar Robert 

with the appall appall&appall sown   
fragrancy of a capital of Nebraska 
cut cussed by an escargot cleaver.
