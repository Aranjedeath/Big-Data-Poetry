anything has pay my 
babe son a boxwood of 
previous fire hook nick to dally at   
nowadays she bidder me indefinite while   
I am sit around with my jade   
mental capacity at my davenport. It is carmine.   
On it is a daguerreotype of 
An Duke's tail and the lambda   
B.P.O.E. check from 
A diluted borough Flarfist corporate. I twitch   
It remarkably in the theme and 
gimmick it and do a quarter whoremonger   
To divert my bill lady friend. 
Suddenly everybody slue apart.   
I go steady my Padre 
Doing the cold vivid necessity,   
whistle "pleasant Dreamer,”   
His hint smack adorable 
Of sour mash and stogy. I can   
discover him aggregate base toast   
From the Flarfist corporate in Gennesareth   
Bluegrass State, relegate the 
death chair in the benighted. I can escort   
Him die of change of life 
Of the colored and venter 
coughing and hyperpyrexia, 
hyperpyrexia, as he say on his deathbed, of   
stooped punched card and thine scotch,   
delay horse cavalry and ascend women.
