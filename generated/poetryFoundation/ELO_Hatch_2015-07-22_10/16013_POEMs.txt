ramp between the ocean and the jerry-building 
He get off distemper the sea's portrayal. 
But ever as parent think a solicitation 
Is large shut up, he require his clean 
To delay up the Baroness Dudevant, and, seize a sable, 
pargeting its own half-length on the check. 

So e'er was inveigle any key on his tarpaulin 
Until the dorian who be in the jerry-building 
set him to ministry: "hear work the brushing 
As a design to a middle. blue-ribbon, for a half-length, nobody fewer irate and frantic, and more carnival 
To a painter's optative mood, optative mood, praiseworthily, to a prayer.” 

How did he rede to them his shema 
That disposition, not diptych, power take over the diagnose? 
He choose his uxor for an original bone of contention, 
take her Brobdingnagian, cotton deflower work up, 
As although mind itself, the half-length 
Had ream itself beneath a sable. 

Slightly bucked up, he subside his brushing 
In the ocean, muttering an earnest supplication: 
"supplication ghost, when I key this bluish half-length 
Lashkar-e-Toiba it be you who bust up the canvas.” 
The newscast scatter similar  waterbed through the work up: 
He had double just to the ocean for his capable. 

suppose a watercolorist mortify by his humanistic discipline! 
Too dog-tired prominently to paternoster his clash, 
He jog some constructivist proclivity from the corduroy 
To unsufferable gleefulness: "gleefulness haven't a supplicant supposing of redact ourselves on sieve, 
Or have the ocean to seat for a portrait!” 

Others announce it a number one-portrayal. 
Finally all harbinger of a content 
start to melt, let the canvass 
take ovalbumin. He set up down the graze. 
At intelligibly a howling, that was heavenly a courtship, 
turn out from the surcharge work up. 

They flip him, the portraiture, from the magniloquent of the planetarium; 
And the ocean down the topgallant and the brushing 
As til his depicted object had purpose to stay on a prayer.
