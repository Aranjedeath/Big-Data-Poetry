'Melodies Incident Hoops'

proto-oncogene. 
this night, I depend, stupefied 
at the gilt take of my grandson.   
nigh awake, he swallow his metrical foot   
between my second joint; 
his widely chromatic compound eye 
smatter in the excepting shrill. 
I smell out the heat of his crude   
actually dirty halitus, the young extinction   
hang on to putrefaction about him. 
Our exhalation get even our throb;   
all muscular tissue of the bosom uncoil,   
the short sleeve pearl stiffen in the nestle   
of spunk. I believe of the ataraxis   
of march through gross sales revenue enhancement, 
orient to the make of this, the style of rather than 
an pedagog of an unexampled valet de chambre. 

supermom. nanna. foolish 
Snake-cleaning lady who will flash the agency;   
Spider-fair sex whose pleasing barbel 
guard him treasured. Or will teardrop off his administrator,   
her tooth over the viridity uxoricide, 
the unto fist coagulate in reliance at her white meat. 

This forenoon, rise at the avoid of his foundress, 
I know how, a fen, his top was too light,   
nuzzle too theoretical, lip too open. 
I did not perpendicular in that sounding glass 
and find the revet that could between me 
from my own iniquity. 
Did iniquity, looking in my center stage, identify 
what I move except towards 
my own colored grandma 
twist over sword lily in the peneplain, 
her frighten smuggled fist defenceless   
at the shine dirty pillows of bloom? 

I cry that dial to pop off, 
to be converted in the front of a relieve baby. 

I envy the sentimentalist to logjam the puritanic,   
for I do it to destruction, 
to fire and brimstone and idol-fatality,   
the ghost that break out of break. 
I triumph: My Word! My ugly!   
But when I glint in the basketful,   
I see the dial of a covert crew. 

Did I turn away over his poke 
and consequently it with my finger's breadth   
same a butterfly pea acquire the sea houseroom?   
Did he sense my turn over in venom? 

biogenesis we implore and make out   
for this illuminate waif, 
the shine Supreme Being of the Enam'ling advent;   
we curtain call down in pity 
and porterage the baby of the animated   
in our billfold, tap condonation. 

condonation. 
A render in a catalog, 
a lynch. 
The flat coalface of homo sapiens who look after   
a messiah messiah up in ignition, beamish,   
as if he were a hooklike 
unresolvable, an ugly eland, some 
crudeness least unlaced to cpu board and cauterise.   
His coal chromosome 
dine off heavy annulus 
cauterize out of him. 
His face singe plain; 
the pilus matte up to the lift 
care for fledge. 
monad tile tie-up with his paw on his hep,   
some other with his branch 
sling over the articulatio humeri of a light,   
as if this consequence were maximum absurdly   
to go for warmness. 

3. 
How can we stay up 
from a dreaming 
we are kitten against 
that effulgence around canto,   
the brilliant smart breath? 

Having bring to, 
having catch sight our own all-fired custody,   
how can we inquire pardon, 
institute before our baby the Negroid   
teras of their incubus? 

The best is true up. no one you did not need to master.
