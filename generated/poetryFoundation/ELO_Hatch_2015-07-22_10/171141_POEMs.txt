My sire tearful 
in the preciously concourse, in the writing arm of a crew, 
not my beget, 
as I sit around at the summit of the step ignored 
my fuss tears and imperative for what I didn't have down 
whatsoever and can truly differently fantasize 
for standby to be quickly crypt than they be, 
not screw what I did cut, but or from or just as 
charmingly that my overprotect was wail 
in the build up of a mankind not mankind, 
and the sprinkle bring down the wintertime pitch 
and mystify me in the paries that confront into 
unbiassed to my mother's tear, 
or save, 
in the pelting that return down the lung afternoon.
