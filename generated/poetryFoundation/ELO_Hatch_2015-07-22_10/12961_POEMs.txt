What's geographics? What quarrel what alp

its wash out  foamline beetle incomplete the admass. 

On a stab felloe sharpness into vortex of flip,   
foot are no lynchpin. sombreness tit at the attend to   
sugarcoat the stock-leaden particle chief descending. 

The mass that had run a legendary visibility   
on the day's skyline is a mudra of former   
fluctuate  gingham above strike blank, above   
a map out of the public. disturber of the spiritual world,   
instigator of the blow in which we deflection   
struggle against laying waste gawp eastwards. 
The confidential information malfunction. The breather hold. The deception of birth.   
The refuse berm  selfhood prowl   
Cicily Isabel Fairfield in impeccant only airwave, as beat, as intense.
