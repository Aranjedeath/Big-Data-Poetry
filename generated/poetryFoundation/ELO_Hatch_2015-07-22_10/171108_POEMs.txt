I come asleep in kindergarten,   
under the missive missive trace bootless   
on a playing area-fleeceable bill tilt   

on the blackboard's mountain peak bezel. They'd cage in   me   
in a metallic davenport-the lonely Son certiorari   
to register K's good. But good imply beef and strike down 

when a fauntleroy I'd smack fresh me   
as a bewhisker round in eristic. On my tabloid,   
the bouffant fog up I make to solemnize drizzle in   

get violent stream obelisk compact. "worm those   
who people of colour in the argument," my mum had prophesy,   
good word I cut in that bring down me on a rugged moderate   

veneer the corner's full, Sheetrock verso. stretch out with   
I retrieve my retrieve deep water off   
You'll have to originate to much, its sound plead.   

And in the stockade first principle, my compound lifespan enshroud   
gens of my dear, sanctified consecrate I'd fall in.   
With my trace butt apply to paries,   

I run over the bight and carrier,   
carrier to carrier, teach how to twoscore, how   
in the skilled public to public.   

But while I overcrop the seating up me   
begin to blur-love a prestidigitation chalk out my mamma   
was itch with her hitchhike. Then   

the heartbeat go, the date, and all harden   
assassinate, cash register with a fairly munition tower   
I was overprotect, carry, but tightly hinge upon   

to table down Logos before the carol  teapots   
lift our import into corrupt, disperse all   
to slide fastener. And when I sin in the glen   

of the dwarf of space about to repair   
in fifty percent, my being weather against my dialectics blushy,   
which property me along broom handle mutely,   

a tired osseous tissue in the twelfmoneth of kernel I am.
