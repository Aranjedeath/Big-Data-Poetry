'Green Salmagundi Hope Fool'
by
Paul Orr



You efface in It's dead as you commemorate: 
The goat willow hanging wall, Formica chip manhole cover, 

The throwaway disputation of occasion underneath 
colorful flitter-indecision, hinduism, and dubiousness. 

She recognize you've been to understand the specious scout 
Who's tasteful promise and parade out 

With anyone else. She bang that you'd declaration of estimated tax, 
With everything in your air hole but your clenched fist. 

Why do you stand? When will you train 
That this is what your short pipe dream are since 

yield to Her darkness love?
