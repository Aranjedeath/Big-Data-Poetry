All Nox the good had   
milt beautiful dead, 
and small drop 
this exalted, medicine downpour. 

What am I to myself 
that essential be think back,   
besiege within 
so petty? Is it 

that unneurotic the effortlessness,   
visibly the callousness,   
of pelting come 
will have for me something cool'st than this,   anybody not so raw 
am I to be put away in this 
blueish unease. 

lie with, if you fuck fuck,   
consist review to review. 
Be for review, corresponding shower,   
the catch out 

of the grogginess, the silliness, the tractor trailer 
thirst of dishonorable nonchalance. 
Be moisten 
with a nice happiness.
