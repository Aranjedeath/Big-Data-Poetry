How hour revere   
The humble in middle!   
I now top octameter   
Who drive at ventriloquism. 

But I sopor substantially.   
manque broth of a boy 
Whose important casuistry well up   
With glorious racket, 

look down on me non! 
And be not full   
To compliment cheerly:   
poetize is not gentle. 

But wrath who does not 
clock that suborn me   
dependable feel and nose   
Of craziness seasoned me.
