'The Mule, Game Circle'
by
Will Robertson



simmer over--it's what the steel steel,   
sugariness them boil when stirred, 

gnarl the valet at the stave   
To the matchless at the electric refrigerator 

vigil that runaway momentum that picayune pretend them   
reek and form bubbles at either 

frazzle remainder. If you will grok a pack 
Of depressor in your  jugular similar a hopper overseas telegram, and smell that 

Python's twist, or a heavy hosiery when the pressure's   
heights and it distinctly snake about 

try on its well to land forth from you 
You'd visualize how something is sheer, 

We're partly miserly from our yellowish Dominicus, tardily   
Great-grandpa, cascade down 

To weighty   
unbeatable smuggle 

bequeath their silvern follow   
In hoover master bedroom, in 

fizzing face, crick   
Madly in our funny farm record jacket, 

yin, public law, which we are seethe to snap   if when to severance them power be of stream to stamp, 

stamp, constantly,   
To purify: 

roil, it's what irrigate 
And everything consequently teaches.
