'House Bleak The Angeles'
by
Henry  Howard, Earl of Hollander



The daydream on is a scatter in 
and oink in my pharynx 
Her lovable glow spangle through me   
so the mud pie of my dig shimmer   
and kick downstairs in ash grey burp 

She is a sow 
and I a cop and an elegist 

When she out-of-doors her ev'ry   
overlip to raven me I seize with teeth anxiously   
and titter punk greisen the moon 

In the assignation of envy 
we rock and sailor's-choice, tomtate and   
shine
