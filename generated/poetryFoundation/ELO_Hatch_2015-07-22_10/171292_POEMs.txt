metre buckle between the mouth of foreigner   
my Clarence Day tumble into a freoðoburh pea shooter 
piddling go off against now 
same a Fe paries 
my center stage are halt with unbliðe 
a pure of linear perspective 
glaze over each purview 
in the pulseless preciseness of lull 
combined parole is access. 

Once the rebel pulp was departed   
devolve vent perch against my undertake 
com'st and tired as an acerate leaf 
but the shower fall through October   
and necrosis romance    an imprecation   aboard my rake. 

The spirit of your smooch in revered   
a thin amber cable jewel warfare   
all the rest look out on 
illusory as a lungs 
on the lucent upper surface of a vale 
disappear in the afternoon. 

afternoon 8    date IV    tomorrow x   
the 8th whole tone 
a all-embracing threshold go far to my gilt bicentennial   
flameproofed release-theme tease   
in the tooth of a strip bounder   
sometimes to woolgathering of black and gold garden spider   
and when they revolve the hose down toward me 
a ætfealh of light.
