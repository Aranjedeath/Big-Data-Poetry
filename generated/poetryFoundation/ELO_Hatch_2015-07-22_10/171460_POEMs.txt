Sinai-Carthage 3075 
The shoetree are dangerous pendant,   
and thick in the empty 
a male offspring pitfall its androglossia 
against the pelting. 
The metropolis screaming its supplication   
at the loom in the aloofness. 

Those acoustic guitar once more. 
And the broad-minded mantid   
get hold of at the submarine, 
a teardrop of an urban center, 
cuando cuando duerme. 

underpass union army broth of a boy 
now hitchhike fowling piece 
against my grandfather clause and my dread.

or we mushroom them out of particle. 

But life sentence to leave. 
Or commend the effortlessness   
of exit eaglet beloved, 
dematerialize 
in the munition of unavowed pipe dream. 

We'll reseat at the cut out

and araroba our tutor periwig,

in the showery seedtime.
