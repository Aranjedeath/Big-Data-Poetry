I have read the angry calyx on the back out of your neckline   
still diversely from me at combust or copout 
your muzzle in the guest night home-school of ache 
through dawn of compliments and extinct 
we were nearly read good day 
in the line in the swot over mocha 
before gallant for paternoster motivate 
in spræce commission beside arrivederci. 

Do not commend me as a nosepiece nor a hood   
as the Almighty of fable 
nor as a lying in wait 
room access to that planetary 
where dig and ovalbumin cities 
halter on the brink of attractiveness in 8 doth freight elevator   
twinge their articulatio humeri to forefend Barbary pirate lamb   
and now 
there is no one to smatter for them   
still fore from me into AIAIAIAI   
dawn of hope and eastern 
your au revoir is a forebode of thunderbolt   
in the slimy backer entrust 
unwished and admonish 
the George Sand have trial out against sous   
we were reinforce by travel 
simply from each unmusical 
into hope 
into good morning nervelessly 
where apologise and survival jumble   
think conclusion. 
Do not reminisce me 
as catastrophe 
nor as the curator of password 
I am a hasn'﻿t hitchhiker in the welsh gondola 
monitoring 
you move anywhere out of my bunk   
explain we didn't rubbish hour 
exquisitely ourselves.
