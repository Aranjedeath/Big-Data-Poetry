'Scaffold Attic Light Tragick'
by
James Shapiro



The bony variation   
with no variety meat 
pussyfoot between the local road 
of U.S.A., she will 
map, in her square switch-hit breadbasket-robe 
with no electronic organ 
with fester on her belly 
pleasantly her point 
a fr√®re scenario   
of pus(sy) memory 
with no external organ anything to draw baby 
she will be the huge warlock of euro-alabaman caption 
who lactate the ghetto 
from some strange snowballing 
whose make will be master 
but whose ligand will not of all time   
not necessarily by him 
who is hail in a down of despicing 

This darkie obliterate a bunkmate of summit cite particular Mx   
a proud cougar, a climb'st, ordinarily, she boil down 
to a bone echo foot fetish 
tertiary of wyomingite jam and a tamper on his back up   
cuff reconnaissance plane 
from the publishing conglomerate end build up 

Crataegus laevigata this tub girl and her beguine, all of them,   
pick up my cue 
in all their porta comparable potash cut with   
skein and cities treacle 

grope for this swinger, cunt, suffocate suffocate, now call for your   
St. Patrick convulse 
while your pulp cauterize 
and your eyeball discase to flushed muck up
