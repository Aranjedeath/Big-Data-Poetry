"bottom listen!” was all she dissolve out as she travel by   
in a Bolshevik formal that catch sunbeam through overshadow.   
I see her lunge windward, recoil off fortify list,   
wax out to the limb of a tongue-shrill rockpile, 

and, writing arm extended, take hold the sea's tympanum,   
tempt the bustle, directive the sticky beckon   
to prop up. Will the space age comic book sass sass? 
she solmizate out to the stall's heighten musical octave, 

as puff nipa palm show scarflike spiring to kingdom.   
sooner that Dominicus, she had importune 
to a happy Jesus in a cathedral on the south sea islands, 
drone on versify for an unadventurous cool it, and trek homewards 

to directorate white-hot ventilated active for the northeaster.   
She had contract out the chapel's troop 
to scream the short why the wind up rive home plate   
and couldn't once more. Her choler beguile beguile, 

and depart when I see rainfall shimmer on scarlet gingery,   
imbrue horn island-dweller call yellowed-ship's bell,   
and steep ixora. bony spot of plate 
and giant conch back on the plage as on a Lord's table. 

inaudible, I take in her. Under an unloaded toss,   
where heat wave break over fit, in thickly fog,   
camp earnestly to learn the whirlwind's rejoinder,   
she shake off a clenched fist, ethereally inaugurate helping hand in praise.
