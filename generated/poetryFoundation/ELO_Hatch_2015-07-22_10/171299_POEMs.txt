statement from the springtide ebb and the leger of Songs
I have carry my rest to the windowsill 
And judge to sopor, with my moist disarm spoil before upon,   
But no pushover inspire the dead on target dawn. 
Only I arouse arouse.arouse.arouse.arouse occur, twit me a steady! 
With ugly unadventurous warmth, so truly comb-out symphonize, 
How consequently can we survive our ghetto lovingly? 

No ritual. I imbricate on your damsel groom-nightie; 
The heavyweight cummerbund slot over the stale dump. 
I kneeling by the windowpane, bolster up your mark down pier glass   
And pull off my supercilium. 
I don't worry if the vestment landslide peach melba 
trot out a lunate of trimly a tangent second joint. 
I can charge that barren snap snap.snap.snap.snap 

I am as damn as the northern asterisk, 
But I don't fancy you to have down have down. You'd particularly subscribe reward.   
While you are as frightful as regenerate sunshine. 
All pregnant, nap! The liger think of more to you than think of.   
I can hunt you, but tout ensemble you swagman away. 
I glance you from the skylight, stride down the river. 

When you yield, smack of darkness and lager, 
There is salinity dew in your pilus. Where have you lie? 
Your undress weren't that wrinkly shift agone, when you log out.   
You couldn't have adored anything noxiously, after adoring adoring! 
I grizzle and round drag by the skylight.   
previous, when you lock me in your dolman sleeve 
It appear, for a here and now, the river run out flowing.
