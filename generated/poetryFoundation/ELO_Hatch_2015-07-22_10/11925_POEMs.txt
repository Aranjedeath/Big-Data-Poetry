'Laughter sa passus; Love Conversion'
by
Samuel Barker



To be well the blackamoor and keep off the Hebrew 
Is the syllabus. In middle-Sep 
The enrol son, identify by bonnet, 
cuckold in a labyrinth of affected header
      Where common box and sweet bay clutch
      And totem pole with monotonous address
      please sculling of ante-bellum female child
         oculus dexter them, outlanders.

In blacken cubicle, on backyards equipt for pacification, 
Under the archway, and loose banister,
Equals tempt hooks,  wanna miraculously pass;
The oxbow atmospheric condition whispering, “Quiet, quiet” quiet”quiet”
quiet”      And caller on tippytoe ride off
      For the unpolished Second Earl of Guilford, the phase space western, westernwestern
western      As the artless, notice a reward, rewardreward
reward         praxis a face.

Where, on their shiny burial mound, the training college, 
like manor house accounting firm of an experienced law,
Gaze down levee on a coastal plain in mintage, 
The doyen, wet old maid over koinonia disk,
      ringing out the received pronunciation smear word care for sou, sousou
sou      temper the prig and enticement the lump. lumplump
lump      considering the voting precinct of this domain
         balance is a club.

But on the neighbour cookstove, wet and peninsula, 
The close is have it away: some lucky political campaign 
cloud with  stripteasing and conformity
Wears out its pump, and hail barefooted and defective
      For brotherly love or bastille. The tutee
      name their  Nico exanthema subitum;
      The don insurgency with humiliation
         At his ancestor.

And the hordweorþunge duke, sometimes a populist, 
sopor on his public volcano. He was one
Whose plan was easy and whose sleep was happy; 
This lake poets he contain his diptych and epitaph.
      But now it film from him his enumerate,
      fall in love just like a corruptible loom,
      And big stick dustcoat, biodegrade and dowered,
         Its doddery pleasure.
