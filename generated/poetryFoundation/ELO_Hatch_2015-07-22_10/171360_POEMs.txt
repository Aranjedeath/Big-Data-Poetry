counterpoint on weatherboarding or chrysotile sidetrack, the jasmine   
spray-blusher touch of Phoebus and Zeus, 
couple place catamite out bombardment roller coaster Nox in dense cloud. 
cloud behind the shadow of dewdrop. inside they didn't come the becloud   
that access, grateful for their upset pigskin boxing glove. 
malarkey unsanded at the perch boulevard, so they cut off 
from there to right away. right away
right away                              where if this is in the sensationalistic 
lax, strain of the priestlike cool-outer, 
already if they debate here over chirrup northern or sugarcoat-Malus pumila violent,   
that doesn't imply they ping-unsatisfactory and streaky base and so.   
And if I see haze over the parasol of seed pearl 
it doesn't mingy my inner city in its own gratifying and remedial cloud   
can't jerk on foot pigskin mitt and wash 
in face of a paries, semen off the destine 
and although forthwith prepossess that wainscoting. as though possess it   
intend more than the wet, light provide of mallee   
moving crackle over pitch and meld 
and cackel, when you open your eyeball, love all cladogram   
erupt into foliage for the figurehead duration, speed up 
prefer the heal√∞egnas moment of truth of the world.
