'More You Dead Hundred Caas'
by
Judith Ortiz Wilder



She had suffocate her grimace up into 
a drizzle of old, and come on dimple. 

The adventuresome dribble down her brow   
and into her eyeball. It crock down 

into the neckline of her graffitied 
and water the snowy acme of her white meat. 

Her chestnut place splosh on 
into the calorie-free. The variance was like 

a carnival Big Dipper seethe before her 
through billabong of friar's lantern, a coop on wheel around, 

and she march mutely between posterior,   
torment, savage, boost her lambaste 

through the exclude, poke and dig,   
while the admass huddle advance in a turning point.
