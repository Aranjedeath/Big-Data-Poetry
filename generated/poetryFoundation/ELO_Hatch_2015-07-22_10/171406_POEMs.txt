It is neandertal man, that further in the good-pass gas   
absolutely snorter will bump; it is dim-witted, 
What's through with is admit. The pauli exclusion principle, forward we malevolence   
Our misogyny, check no give notice in the fluke 
But by the gage, and not for pensiveness eventually   
It execute, but for the pacifier that's underachieve. 

And still craw-chokingly is the repulsion of the record,   whenever we anticipate not the checker. To six-spot in hoosegow,   
To be flutter to end, to know the roleplay   
Of cavern out rage before the compound eye can betray   
And the bachelor die out against the moth-eaten fey fence in   
Of the eternally worldwide-and incomplete is that complete: 

There is the scourge too of each man's reason,   
That recognise non, but moldiness even so surmise   
His neighbour, upholder, or ego of being unteach   
To convey an irreverence descending spare;   
Being scared of his own cool persona in   
The ice of realpolitik, and his own hell, 

terrified as if Pisces plowboy theatre and panopticon paries 
Be quarry of monad chromatic, lest damn and ev'n   
aspect footling simper down and make to birdsong   
A treason the receive bump of shore leave,   
And any world a lawless who grieve   
The chauvinism of a couple of thieves.
