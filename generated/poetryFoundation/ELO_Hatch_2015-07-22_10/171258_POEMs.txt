pleasing, and cable car, pitch, stab perforation toward pit 
a unmannered taxonomy of sterling, car pool byword crown of thorns out   
compressed, sense. if when lecture, rust. rust
rust                                                          I come disregarded 
from where I sit decoct in my cerebellar vein, small dread   
at the rest of gentleman, the decease of digestion, in 
halitus awe, at my ain. wild-eyed singlet of conspicuous necrobiosis   
vacuous at the canthus, space when they elevate their index 

Ixion the spirit, in inactive pulp distribute so wast   
are their whopper. So fleshy, their supremacy, of these   
dopy spade. piano spik stamp out each wet, and will not 

progress to the all day long misstep to Augustine's. Will not smash-up their chromium steel   
foot, against the complex presumption of so ugly an omerta as gather. 

You are no comrade, o'er woogies, die under rejuvenate peel, in David's   
sagging black tie. cheerleaders of the compulsive, at the soul's crisis, a   
repose, they aim will above them from our heart. without vertebral column of the past 

where the carnival will not carnival. At the back out of overcrowd, bend and crude   
inhale contemn ultima, face the music plunder of all that dawdle in   
our Modern earth. pop in unregretful dialog box bearskin, they align so short at what 

light bondwoman did to my pater. They muster up muteness. They supplicate at the   
pace of theoretical prison house, to be male monarch, when all is quiet, when all 
is chromatic. When sure enough the unreasoning yield of their lumbus is gilded, or anyone   
simply they would break bread.
