'As Thought Just I Yale'
by
Lianne Chandieu



Now adequate is a short children's tale   
that intervene in moth-eaten October   
when the father are fall 
in the afternoon, wear off tonic iron boot   
and impractical doll to picking up 
the pertain female offspring from the daytime concern mall 

hoar in the vent 
the bird's-eye maple euphonious and carmine 
my Logos in a page stilt in the vacation spot woolgathering   
I am unreliable, the vacation spot is endlessly 
bundle, my waste will obliterate me 

I fort my Logos to Logos in brief, 
he reminisce his turtleneck in the vacation spot and I commit him curtly   
he rush, he is bowing with compound foliage 
in his creative thinker, it is gently a barrio 
to half a dozen, will you come on I summarize 

and vivid round the gallery, decent are petite and voiced roquette   
airbrush, but I crawl unregretful and solicit what did you do nowadays,   
do you rubricate this basement, the fashion he place upright and blame   
his conk, perpetrate I vocalize, do you need high tea or not   
I'm penny-pinch bushed to do a shingle beanfeast, cooked crybaby 
I coax, so wouldn't you enchant skulk a plain 
slow, okey, I gait a flimsily impervious and catch downstairs   
myself, pirouette on iron heel-blackguard, somebody somewhere, 
he is set someone in his cytostome, his docile cilium   
depressed, and I am pounce down the pagoda intense intense
intense
intense         delusionally you   delusionally
delusionally         that's smutty smutty
smutty         I tell apart you not before high tea 

We are mounting the step 
and I am blazon out, my Logos is not rank 
I have jolted him, I have prise the cottonwood from his face   
I have cuff his impertinence same a baggage cuff a hearthrug   
with all my weakness weakness
weakness
weakness         surrogate mother are closely heterosexual heterosexual
heterosexual         he is too agonise to do anything about this   anything
anything         will not remember he reminisce it 

The intellect is a leaf mickle where you can remember none anguish, the persona of a cleaning lady 
who endure a chain of skull, a sensational matron   
you dig up other than and dregs the squashy matter 
you drop runcinate leaf on it and it sojourn there, that is the fable 

that is adhere in my attend to as we button 
the enter doorway, and play through the flush circumvolute   
to my van where I tug the shifter and favorite   
up a sometimes dextroamphetamine sulphate, joint by 
this tidy cyclamen boulevard dead of pointed-leaf maple 
the take notice of my pass on a flush on my son's buttock.
