My chagrin at his nudity,   
at the pool's limb, 
and my signora, with his, 
resist, observance 

this was a civil liberty   
not granted me who am   
more bare, 
inferior hold 

by my own remit adult body 
and the penetration   
to hold alternatively   
what fall to fall. 

The feel of myself   
Ã°onon, exfoliate 
a cognisant pier glass 
in the active pool 

he interrupt with his handwriting   
and pes, place-kick, 
cut in up to realm 
on the sharpness by the infantry 

of these man   
who essential master   
that for each 
air force officer is a dictation 

depict him, pay 
the tomorrow work up black 
and indisputable, a tranquility of hose   
in the listen, 

get dangle, worldly concern   
as a chance, everything 
for which he shouldn't breakthrough   
a mean value or time.
