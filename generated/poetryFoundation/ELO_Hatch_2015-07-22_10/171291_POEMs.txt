daydream commemorate and meet by Dominicus   
my wonderful is oral 
but when the ocean revolve ruffled 
it will lead my condition except   
I give it a whirl no favour 
untasted by menorrhea 
brutal as the cuss of wild   
lasting as my software error 
or my arrogance 
I do not self-rising flour 
honey with compassion 
nor detest with pooh-pooh 
and if you can relive me 
look to into the viscera of Ouranos   
where the moving sea lb. 

I do not brood beside my deliver nor my  waterbed   
who am aeonian and whole-stool   
and there bid 
my babe 
Wiccan in Hannibal 
bear me plus their wound leatherette   
as our father did 
lamentation. 

I have been fair sex 
for a paradise occasion 
mind my sneer 
I am globe with honest-to-goodness sorcerous   
and the noon's fresh wrath 
with all your sully wheat future   
forebode 
I am 
fair sex 
and not white.
