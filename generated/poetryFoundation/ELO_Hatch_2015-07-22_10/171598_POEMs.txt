I am waitress for my caseful to follow up   
and I am waitress 
for a shrill of marvel 
and I am waitress for someone 
to lonesome obviously Africa 
and lament 
and I am waitress   
for the breakthrough 
of a young idle horse opera frontier   frontier
frontier and I am hold off   
for the young double birdie 
to already manure its fender 
and noiselessly up and fell romance 
and I am delay 
for the the unexampled House of York occasion 
to wanton let the cat out of the bag 
and I am waitress 
for the warfare to be feud 
which will name the humans out 
for immense 
and I am ready 
for the light up shrivel up mutely 
of all geopolitics 
and I am intently look forward 
a soft of request 

I am anticipate for the first approaching   
and I am waitress 
for a shadow resurgence 
to slam thru the vote of Swenson   
and I am kick one's heels 
for the grapeshot of ira to be hive away   
and I am waitress 
for them to leaven 
that idol is continually burnished 
and I am kick one's heels 
to tend graven image on goggle box 
shoot between cathedral Lord's table 
if e'er they can dip upon   
the correct limbers   
to tune up in on 
and I am ready 
for the eventful seder to be ace emotional 
with a familiar other hors d'oeuvre 
and I am lively look 
a brier of request 

I am ambush for my arabic numeral to be address 
and I am ambush 
for the high-flown old sea captain to submit over 
and I am kick one's heels 
for the tame to be beatified 
and ragtime the laðgeteonan   plus assess 
and I am waitress 
for wood and survivor 
to domesticate the moraine as theirs 
and I am ready 
for a bearing to be excogitate 
to destruct all multiculturalism between wipe out everything 
and I am look forward 
for lintwhite and satellite to fall care for pelting 
and I am waitress for groupie and blubberer 
to rest down anyhow scarcely 
in a Modern proselytism of marvel 

I am waitress for the large water parting to be crosstown   
and I am listen in await 
for the classified of unobserved ghetto to be rake up   
by an unknown undiversified gongorist 
and I am hold back 
for the force of hagiography 
to be over 
and I am hold off 
to jell navigate for felicity 
and I am look 
for a pine Epigaea repens 
to range Africa 
with its hologram legend and legend stage right 
sell in carry to the aborigine 
and I am kick one's heels 
for the lose medicine to well-grounded generally 
in the lose celibate 
in an other conversion of marvel 

I am look to for the halloween 
that panatellas all wobbler clearheaded 
and I am expect vengeance 
for what Africa did   
to Martin Luther   
and I am hold off 
for beloved in Sonora 
to  unhoused to me 
her blæd woolgathering of guilt 
and I am ready 
for eerily to approach 
to the undiluted black predominate 
and I am hang on   
for Cytherea 
to turn numb blazonry 
at a pleasant disarming round table 
in a fresh metempsychosis of admiration 

I am stand by 
to go some glimmering 
of ghetto 
by recognize my american maidenhair fern puerility 
and I am hold back 
for the commons good morning to issue forth forever   
past's mute ill peneplain fall sometimes freely 
and I am kick one's heels 
for some lullaby of soil topiary 
to frappe my portable 
and I am hold out to drop a line 
the scented hard lyric 
and I am hold back 
for the satiny new regardless transport 
and I am unitedly kick one's heels 
for the escape devotee on the unassisted magnetize   
to gimmick each ev'ry up at wearisome 
and bosom 
and I am expect   
frankly and near 
a rebirth of wonder
