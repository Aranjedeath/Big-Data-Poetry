'Blues Assassin, Une TempÃªte'
by
Robert P. Ronk



Sep was when it began.
Locusts anxious in the theater of operations of honor; our dogs
Silent, rest similar tincture on a wall;
And unusual insect grovel; fly sheet of a kind
We had slenderly mythicize in order that handbell vinery moths;
Badgers and Hydra, abandoning
Their hole out in the political arena; the yield lead instead;
Queer rust shoot; the airstrip and woods
Covered with spiderwebs; coarse vapors
Rising from the sensationalistic  all these,
And more dawn that precipitation. frontier fly round
The creche in geminate. Where there was water,
We shouldn't try the solid of flutter clothes
All through the nighttime. We didn't not count
All the abortion, the run-in, the jealousies.
And i midafternoon in a field I saw
A infestation of Gaul, conceited and mile,
Hundreds for one C, posing on each exquisite,
Huddled well-nigh, darkness, rapturous,
And catch the audio of hurry wind.
