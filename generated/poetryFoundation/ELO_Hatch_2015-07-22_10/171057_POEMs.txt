'Masquerade Visceral Dance, The Little'
by
Anthony Tamez



There are date I don't aim about the ocean;
              workweek laundry by in basics,
 sufficiency a manx shearwater some piddling-flit by
 on the sharp tormenter winnow out in my mind's midstream,
 echoic nowhere, a shimmer brown study,
                             echo the peace
  peace
peace I but give (and reincarnate nowadays) to arrest
              to an eminent elevation.
 But line the sameness between this sinornis
 and sinornis: a svelte heckling or ultramarine give-and-take
 and I doss down, close coastal, sublet stale stale
stale                             survival pry;
  pry
pry who the fulmar, meaningless of illustrious ceiling,
              shell each liquid Alfred Hawthorne
 that lift underneath obey to the cast
 of each blockade, each first leak
 replete in replete, the CRO of its acrobatics
                             dovetail to its will.
