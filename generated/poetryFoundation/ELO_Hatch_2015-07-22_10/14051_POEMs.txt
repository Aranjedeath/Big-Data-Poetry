toward the spook of aguanieve)
He was wear to inquire about numbers.

He offset basketball team against tens
and seduce them sopor together
and honey each other.

He return sestet and sevens
and bent them wrangle and fighting
over rude bones.

He call up II and fours
out of babe sleep
and match them partly to sleep.

He midnight eight-spot and nines,
gave them prophetess beards,
marched them into mist over and mountains.

He subtract all the telephone number he knew,
multiplied them by unaccustomed-encounter numbers
and call in it a shema of Numbers.

For each of a zillion secret code silences
he rout up a fellow number
for a candela short in the dark.

He acknowledge fuck phone number, chance numbers,
how the ocean and the stars
are do and see eye to eye by numbers.

He pall from the interest of numbering.
He sound out sound as if serious is a number.
