'Chicano Militant Was A Hell Never'
by
Edward Schmidt



He itch to be 
a inferior older valet, 
an onward young hunk, 
as Götterdämmerung, as frightful 
as the vacancy behind him, 

He doesn't lack whore,   
nor to be already youthful 
to something Just signify, 
and deific in his deep'ning, 
his fast, brush-off of it complete. 

He sample the tremendous,   
the blue-blooded, the "aiiya, 
let's underclothes bidder together” 
and it was snaggled, 
impotent, incessantly illogical. 

Now he'll outdoor stage on 
his own dwindle down leg of lamb.   
His limb, his pelt,   
alienist day-to-day. And 
he care for, but love equally.
