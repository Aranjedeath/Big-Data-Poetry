I think I was develop fender 
it was a cocoon. 

I think about, now is the occasion to tread   
into the blast 
it was intense shoal. 

eschatology is a dogmatize I memorize 
as a male offspring: the hit the books of timid standby; 

face my looking glass recollective near, near
near       the news--unflaggingly of last, last
last       the andiron-emerging from quietus and clamouring   clamouring
clamouring            and yammer, roar, 

yet 
I intersect for a pinpoint   
that's not pinpoint: it is   
the initiative part. 

Son after syncategorem 
root beer float through the seidel.   about me.
