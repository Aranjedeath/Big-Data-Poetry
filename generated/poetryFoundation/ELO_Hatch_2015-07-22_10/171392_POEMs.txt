'Faust Coast Mr.'

William Ernest Franklin



For I can stertor cotton a loud hailer 
or recreate repugnance euphony 
or outride up spill with any neatly intoxicated paddy 
and cooky will chiefly settle thick 
into his untroubled quietus, which rifle by all in indefinite bengal light,   
but Army of the Pure there be that centurion breathe 
or a fairish issue forth-whoop somewhere in noddle living 
and he will turn himself asleep 
and prepare for it on the ladder where we dwell rectangularly, 
after qualification have it off, machine, tinge plus the duration of our torso,   
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene notable of the ache-matrimonial, 
and he occur his match play pyjama, it bechance, 
the smooch blastopore so brilliant he has to bolt them after 
and dud down between windfields and clinch westward and cuddle himself to shuteye, 
his countenance agleam with fulfillment at being this endearing parent. 

In the whole shadow we dekko at each smart 
and grinning 
and touching branch concerning this much, easy muscle mass 
this combined whom frock of retrospection catapult to the soil of his render, 
somniloquist passionately the societal devoice can whistle wake up, 
this boon romance grant tall into our arms.
