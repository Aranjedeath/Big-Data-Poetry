all Nox, we couldn't shuteye. 
Our downstairs neighbour had to pickle 
languish everyone forte the student residence 
A  selfhood or a googly clod, 

And from the porthole by the berth, 
reecho towards my capitulum, 
back street regurgitate pervert inhalation 
In arietta of worship and last. 

simone plenty, amid the mews, 
Avery begin to tucker 
same holdover, and you couldn't scowl 
That ill-reinforced sign, why communities it against 

noonday, the radio source grille 
moan, afford off an inferior shivering 
So that we should misread off our patina. 
The fuel line hack to cloudy their pharynx. 

Our heart were fret similar unravel record sleeve, 
We treasured each our junior dolor 
To herd them uncomfortable until the Nox, 
When it was clip e'er to competitiveness; 

But we were muted, did not necessitate methodically 
To break sous hee-haw now and again, and greens, 
And wouldn't not try ourselves above 
The arietta of end and love.
