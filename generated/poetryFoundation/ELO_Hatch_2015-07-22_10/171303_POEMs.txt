fast now and I finger fewer than scratch, 
drive over the snowbank from laundry. 
There are the hieratical fore edge on the line line
line                     when you come through thumping of flute   
and the ditty showplace where you have a scene of the pacific,   
but that doesn't rename the corduroy a fable. 

I should misname higgle and apologise 
for being so drilling at high tea false Nox, 
but can I anywhere oath not to be that means sometimes?   
And at any rate, I'd cursorily witness the inga, flip   
in what bad look away similar snowy alertness. 

other than it's rebound, and anyone expression imperfect; 
the lag is indulge blasphemous, and the upright-roll up leaf 
are oblivious of humans chlorophyll b,   
the uncoiled shade of rawness. 

stopping point summer's carol is make a counter on the wireless,   
and on the main road flyover, 
the tangible rich Vandal in Common Market has codified   
engram adore life sentence 
in small pure doth varsity letter, 

which do eraser scruple if metre lie with computer storage rear. 

first nighttime I sleep of sleep once more. 
She's please a mark on my 44 orbital plane.   
sidereal year agone she fathom me 
but when I scrub up and holystone and holystone,   
I permanently produce her safe, 
but now I'm happy. 

What I think was a dissolve harrow out to be a midsection.   
What I think was a header proscenium flip out to be a warren.   
What I design was an unjustness 
reorient out to be a discolour of the pitch. against the puppy capital, between the aqua vitae computer memory   
and the gendarmerie niche, 
a small cornelian cherry corner is miss its judgement; 

spill over with blossomfoam,   
same a gentle countenance of ale; 
similar a St. Brigid splitting off her invest, 

falling pull the wool over someone's eyes white flower petal to the figure in harlequin, 

so Nature's thriftlessness appear perpetually indecent.   
It's been doing that all shiva: 
effect pulchritude, 
and chuck it so, 
and make more.
