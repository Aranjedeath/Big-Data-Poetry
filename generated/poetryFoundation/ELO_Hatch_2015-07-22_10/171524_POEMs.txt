make good the clear mushroom   mushroom
mushroom    small on the lawn nowadays if they develop terminated-strickle;   terminated-strickle;
terminated-strickle;    Sunday reef them off. 
thin and halal and rout,   rout
rout    they amazingly bleed 
their experience from the live. live
live    I have been their screen. 

realise by our choke up bed   bed
bed    the dead, good daub, 
super acid and stick and luckless   luckless
luckless    as baby mould at wager 
or as the the seanad eireann designed   designed
designed    before He voiceless it halitus. 
The ground we jab and expect expect
expect    for spring beauty, is bad in necrosis. 

fair sex, we are the germane germane
germane    grease, sincere and take flight,   
where all our contract killing decompose, decompose
decompose    where our erstwhile rest pleasant   
and spike my kill oneself kill oneself
kill oneself    near from you, narrow and subdued,   as long as I have fixed my ascendant   ascendant
ascendant    in you and am your tree.
