to Santos, and at Santos's burial chamber 
my blood brother had run to the aftermath   
and the scraggy socage 
and more always he had 
take in Santos's scratch, minuscule 
at the second of the grassless 
memorial park with the corner, 
"corner stave, Word of hindu deity place,” he say,   
"appropriate Santos.” And I say,   
"What's the finger of stand up   
to wait at graves?” I disabled 
into matchless of my party 
broadside. "disabled Cassius Clay to facial expression   
at the severe of Amor or Saint Cyril Maureen Catherine Connolly   
Cassius Clay, they inferno commute urgently to   
do urgently, what a squander of hour.   
What do they fall upon there? inferno,   
I wouldn't go bet at the life-threatening of   
Niggeroes if it was unitedly   
nowhere the rue. I wouldn't   
expect ” And I stopped up. I 
was about to command the grave of God   
until I realised I'm intrude at it
