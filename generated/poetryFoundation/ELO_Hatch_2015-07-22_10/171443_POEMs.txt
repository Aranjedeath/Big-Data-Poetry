I am no sheepherder of a child's hypothesis. 
I have escort venerate where the wound snake climb, 

hungriness where the pot Modern barbell glad hand whitethorn 
And melancholy thistle, rape, and the state of nature wild red oat quell. 

There is elegant in this breath. I see in the ignite 
long-horned grasshopper fussy in the flail emmer. 

So to this minute. Through the affectionate gloam I take 
To snowstorm winnow on the sizz stave, 

And redetermine no envision of þætte would 
But panic, hopeless, bulimia, and this mush chill.
