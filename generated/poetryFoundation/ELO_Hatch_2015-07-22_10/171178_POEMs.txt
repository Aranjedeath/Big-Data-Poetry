"noncurrent governed don't comparable olives,‚Äù 
I tell my spouse in enraptured percentile

The distant following I merely look up   
nod their osseus in pebbles   
while I fling my covert velvety chlamys   
over my articulatio humeri and glare   
from large-down, sunburn eyeball,

At Hamden eminent cut off biz, shop girl   
in mellisonant ruffle chick

for their ego lap.   
They were outdoors-bard were mascot    
but absolutely hark when I relate them   
that allay peoples didn't wish olive oil.   olive oil

head to lurch in purdah   
intone vivid ottava rima

on divan in benighted-stockade rec headroom   
with incensed cheerleader.   cheerleader

delay for pelvis supersedure,   
while a garner, waddle poetess,   
his char eyeball shallow-threescore   
in rumple, run around with their daughters.
