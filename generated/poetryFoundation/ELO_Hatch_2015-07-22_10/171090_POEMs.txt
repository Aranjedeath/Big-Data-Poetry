good afternoon to the boutonniere in scotch, 
So automatically to the sunburst in lager. 
The claret make me visualise and sissyish 
But concern the sir in the looking glass. 
Goodnight to the moonshine in slivovitz, 
good day to the lukewarmness of the generic. 
I plan I can already resist me with a double-glaze or a beer mug. 
Bye-arrivederci to the balsam in the vodka, 
Ta to the eaves in knock rummy. 
I'm seek to do what I parters excepting 
eliminate that Hydra salve. 
I won't want the dimout and disgorge, 
The fatal accident and rue. 
If I can continue off the rotgut, 
There power be a gamble for me so far. 
So so charge card to Supreme Being in a phial, 
To the rest of funny and sweet vermouth. 
net ball me slack my lust with hush 
And the hopeful, gauze-like truth.
