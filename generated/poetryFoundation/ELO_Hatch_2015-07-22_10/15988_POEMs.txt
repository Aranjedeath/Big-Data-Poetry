'Recollections The Living Magnetic Mountain'
by
J. P. edwards



I'm down of a fold. 
The wether are my thinking 
And my sentiment are all virtuoso. 
I call up with my eyeball and my cauliflower ear 
And my custody and infantry 
And anterior naris and oral fissure. 

To reckon an effloresce is to spectate and smelling smelling. 
To eat on a berry is to modality its sapidity. 

And that is who when I crawl sorrowful, 
In a november 5 of fire up, because of so beautiful pleasure 
And ballad me down in the forage to pillow 
And lasting my Sunday-warm up oculus sinister, 
I hollywood my unreactive particle unbrace in fact 
And bonk the half gospel and am glad.
