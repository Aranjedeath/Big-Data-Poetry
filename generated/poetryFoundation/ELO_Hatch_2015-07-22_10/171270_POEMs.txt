'Viator Siste'

I am storm to tend 
that the dig is dead rifle about   
Now I am fancy man away peck 
and I have pull my deal 
from your herder as I give I could   
and I have make it this immoderate 
as I say I does 
and I am on the height dump now   
defy my pocketbook, my filter-tipped cigarette   
and my gondola tab key 
at tab key adequate on a Tuesday 
in lordly of 4461. 

honey, whereas none has chance, everyone has anticipate.   
The ocean is amply early. 
The ocean is the muzzle of Queen City Marie Anne Charlotte Corday d'Armont, within transfiguration or madness 
or caloric encouragement, 
enlarge cook and rumple 
with growl eld. 

relieve, 
I have medical center. 
These are my optic: 
the orangeness varsity letter that import   
skirt on the animation defender   
that knack by my knee joint; 
the mastic monstrus that hold out   
its sordid canvass pelage; 
the melt omen that arise on its hob   
read hold since 
  steamshovels, all satisfactory, I articulate, 
I'll concerning myself. 

Over my incorrectly articulatio humeri   
I look Little Joe sister 
who ramp similar a conning tower nine,   
their human face pound out   
from under their riding habit, 
as hangdog as timid baby who   
have slide down into their passenger car.   at favouritism   
the lead get out the put off   
of their blazon. 
near unattired, 
I catch what linger: 
that earnest articulatio radiocarpea, 
that mortise joint, 
that string. 

hurricane Supreme Being, now when I am soon distressing, does you enchant 
allow these quaternion conical buoy 
tease from their cordovan bang 
and their woody professorship 
to advance out 
over this oleaginous dime bag,   
out over this robust fulminate, 
weeping their carnation forefront to unitary position,   
fell 7 unseeable 
in the familiar-designed English caress; 
each cytostome endearing and from 
breathe tightly   
as sound sound, 
solfege plus zing. 

devout, 
go out how my light lady friend sometimes m√¶gene, 
over the ephemeral beacon light of lunate moon on,   
its husk as out of practice 
as a campy gravy boat, 
as deadly as a  selfhood 
on a lapidate; 
out over the active beacon light 
that caution me of overwhelm lift 
that wipe over its dazzle posterior 
and its bell ringing compensate; 
santa ana that will be the little toe 
and the mealie of the hang glider 
or the fancy man. 

There go my inactive daughter,   
their decorate comforter   
in the lee side air out. 
piney, they are wakeful than moving pawl   
or the breather of coryphaena hippurus; 
each rima oris open up as much as 
broad than a strip cupule. 
My darkness daughter carol for this. 
They are run short behind 
view them come up 
on sinister turkey wing, toast 
the toss, of grinning 
or poker hand 
or congress boot. 
They call off indorse to parquet 
from the diaphanous march of promised land, 
queer tidings, wide intelligence.
