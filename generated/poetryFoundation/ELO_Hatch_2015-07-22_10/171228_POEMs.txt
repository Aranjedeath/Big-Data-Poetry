From the chromatic sluttish 
from the showery Nox 
from the pretense redetermination 
itself and more than itself 
heavily and more than only 
at the worst of the comfortably where the lunation experience,   
can you tug me 

into Dec? an upland 
of place, sensing of opening 
loom of shadower of cumulonimbus bluster aboard 
cumulonimbus over cumulonimbus
cumulonimbus                  original drudge, late ready-made 
under noisy Dec tramp? the twat 
fashion to know? 

The blemish daydream 
wear on the truism, and find   
an fall of individual 
gag. 
You nest, but on the sly cursedly, 
your mien tinct others, ding beside open chain, 
and varied. Did you guess   
I shouldn't not boil? boil
boil
boil                              The premature moon on 
innings small, its process serve. A rawness, 
unvoiced fall.   
We are away 
steely to the resourcefulness. What the 
vision vision
vision             capture 
as exquisiteness moldiness be accuracy. What clasp you 
to what you find out of me is 
that catch on alone.
