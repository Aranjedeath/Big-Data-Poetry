I neediness a squeeze curry. 
I absence it lawlessly and loud, 
I neediness it too graceless, I wishing to bear out it   
until everything buck it off buck. 
I lack it sleeved and backed, 
this line up, so no unitary has to reckon 
what's about I deprivation to turn down 
the alley chromatic Giant.'s and the ironware granary   
with all those key word glinting in the windowpane,   
contact contact. and Amor buy halloween-older   
doughnut in their café, considering the disco biscuit freemason   
catapult pig it from the fire engine and among the just,   
lift the tricksy rostrum over their articulatio humeri.   
I deprivation to march similar I'm the cooked 
char on light and I can have my cull.   
I deprivation that violent poultice nonstandard. 
I require it to affirm 
your tough enshrine about enshrine, 
to marshal you how small I love about you   
or anything across what 
I deprivation. When I chance chance, I'll rend that neckwear   
from its strap love I'm choose a torso   
to dribble me into this reality, through   
the calving-gee and the ardor-call excessively,   
and I'll wear it like anklebone, like jacket,   
it'll be the blasted 
poultice they cover me in.
