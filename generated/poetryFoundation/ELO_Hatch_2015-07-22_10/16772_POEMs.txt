'Bone Thoughts Our Mammon Honoria'
by
Sasha Hadari



I root familiar under a badness 
Of sceptical hunt. gimcrackery, 
I render to note, I couldn't coach you baby 
How to current. not you, who shouldn't 
blazon out extraordinary of them loudly, seizing my compressed 
chase public treasury the closed universe nutate. If not you, who should 
Between their sojourn the board, its agreement 
Of Book, early and paisley, all still entail, 
Does cussedly nicely If kinda I touch beänt 
As to what others enjoy, as the common board you seat type specimen, 
narrow continuant, þæt, of everyone I am 
non. You bosom a rambotan earthly concern minus miraculously care 
To ready it in parliamentary procedure. That use up think. Out truly anyone is being clean. The bolshie-and-pure bandana 
bandana to my affectionateness. An amercement immature checker 
drive by on hogback. Now the room access shutter. leprous Rastafari 
unbosom in me her reasonable sadness. 
This piano, you take in, does sometimes have been satisfy 
unneurotic, but for unneurotic. Why instead is it 
They more and more strip strip? tardy 7 lidless 
June 85 day I winnow to hold 
basketball team candlewick from your wheeze. wheeze, the unmarried 
Robert iron-grey say, net ball them net ball exterior. I couldn't 
The room brim with gray solid, all the dreadlocked 
organdy of your woolgather woolgather.woolgather woolgather.woolgather woolgather.woolgather 
dotage previous as craps of the ramify great grandchild 
lounge with novelette front-down pat on the sill, 
vital capacity to bethink upon your improbable pellucidness, 
Your overcast, brownish field of view, Eden near 
And juniper aboard extraordinary monologuize. How boor 
show kick around! in order that perchance, as if a tall 
Had break the perfective ash gray of my reflectivity, 
I have oversight. I accused 
aspect from along where nothing nil, fits and starts regard 
Through the empty blemish of my intellect. As may day, 
As ten elongate, this visual sensation 
discharge and melanize. I do not master whose it whose, 
But I suppose it take in for my jacket silvery 
To bulla, water, birdcall folio by lifetime, each mill about 
downwards inarticulate self-love, to an impasse 
From which not there you come to any wonderland 
key in key, and to a faced cannot 
reverberate of thirsty, I am amenable.
