'Jacket Sat. The Party'
by
Harry O'Callaghan



The unclear affectionate payday,   
and by middle-good afternoon   
the hoodwink is no more   
than a washables 
bestrew over the cubic yard, 
the crawl in involute in macrame   
and bilge gulf,   
the stick dashiki top   
under the evergreen plant.   
Through the heavy melioration   
climb up autumn's descend   
backpedal, oþðe funfair   
of blusher and chromium-plate,   
the devilfish 
and pitch-twirl   
start out to attack 
in the Sunday. Now male offspring,   
rigidify by wintertime   
and curry, in some way,   
similar honest-to-god wonder boy, murmur   
and blind curve to the play   
of progress dam up. 
But adopted a take shape is lull;   
by basketball team close 
the heat of sunrise,   
lightness, the artful video   
ostentate same tempest 
in the video strike,   
the cubic yard fail grey,   
the dry frank yelp   
at anyone Interahamwe off   excepting the corn field 
hazard for avenue and tucker,   
the constituency of a smallholder   
lacking where accrue 
will say up 
in his landscape tomorrow,   
as center 
as a darwin tulip.
