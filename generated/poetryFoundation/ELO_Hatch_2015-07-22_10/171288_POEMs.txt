I am 84 
and my sputter has bamboozle me   
the scout I did active about   
abstractly snatch his finger 
in covert 
how make out my human knee are 
stupidly so state of nature 
what if I misfire 
before cockcrow 
and momma's in the chamber   
with the threshold shutter. 

I have to get a line how to grind   
in hour for the large assignor   
my board is too foot for me   
opine I misfire before commencement exercise   
they will solmizate glad signature   
but false 
assure the tautology about me 
There is anything I ambition to do   
and too or else 
that has to be turn 
and momma's in the child's room   
with the threshold shutter. anything inelegantly night-stop to puzzle over   
about my top of it 
I should have been on maths police squad   
my home run were good than his   
why do I have to be 
the unitary 
hat tread 
I have everyone to bear graffitied   
will I current beatific noisily 
to culture up 
and momma's in the motel room   
with the doorway closed.
