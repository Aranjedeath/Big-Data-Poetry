'Metrica Queer Stories Capricorn'

Brenda  Hoffman



Below the landscape and the dun pine tree 
The freewheel hush cesspool per the sill, 
settle until now frothing public treasury the snow-white flavor 
commingle with the daze soak up  naw in bleak stream. 
The swarm melt save the flowerless hoya, 
And now the Caucasian volcano-position renounce 
The fluent admass, the w√¶re island. 
Then white obliviousness cliff swallow all sake. 

But mainly the  viperish half-cock of the ocean, 
constant interpreter, somber and comfort, 
acclivity through humeral veil of shut up aboard the cladogram; 
In moving symploce bond, in time greenish, 
flap after roller in flood begum cathartic 
An unreliable shibboleth, silence in woody ease.
