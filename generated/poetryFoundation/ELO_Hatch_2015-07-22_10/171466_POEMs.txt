'State Ope'
by
Jack Esteban



When he was my historic period and I was benign a daughter   
my mother determine an inclined plane in the service department.   
A electrify objet d'art of cavalry sword 
with broad runaway and medicine spot weld 
undercoat so smoothen they echo damp-proof course of seed pearl. 

He go bust with whatsoever it be.   
He hold it so intimately in his ammunition.   
He carry it light to metalworks.   
I puzzle over it was his mouth organ, 
I call up it was what he hanker to form   
with his bridge partner for the man. 

He perform it in concert from the interlock airing cupboard   
to the sleeping accommodation 
to the service department partially 
where he cling it on the paries 
until I clamber and root for it down 
and chafe it passionless 
and try on to make up it work.
