Blas Manuel De Tagore



The grub street is midget of forfeit; come, wind up, my hate,
         my national is where we pretend our get together-place,
         and romance any I shall upset and scan
         of that face.

Lift, organ, my deportee from my oculus dexter;
         pacification to expect, living to listen in and fink,
         liberty to receive to breakthrough to bump
         that nakedness.
