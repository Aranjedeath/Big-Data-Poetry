'Emptying twenty Dark Field'
by
W. S. Franklin



dusty wedding night excepting the tap star sign in VA 
pick-me-up and grown semitrailer cloakroom tick over, lease their   
haunch fibrillate now and whatsoever in puff of talc bamboozle,   
their renter during for shift, suppress as hardly   
as they can the air mile, the circle knit stitch, the consecutively â€˜mid   
that touch base to everyone but fast and blank and a few   
digress riband of paving, glacial steer to somebody   
but freehanded borough and uninfected public house that coruscation and moratorium:   
Koln, western Lone-Star State. 

hibernate in the bibliotheca of the shoal on the pitcher's mound   
a few afterpiece by Titch Saint Thomas or Divus 
and the real geographic expedition of populace corresponding sufficiency   
northern milium hunker down and waiting but poll brochure   
on DOE and worthy enlisting bill poster glimpse   
by the hopeful asterism. The schooltime jalopy by the threshold, a worry   
snowbank, clangor clean and closed as the spiral lose an unleash   
room access and nag it all Nox, lease the hole   
mujtihad consider off and the house and fumble ever   
over the freeze ground.
