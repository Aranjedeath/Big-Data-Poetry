'Nosegay Sweet et culpa Chess'
by
Allen Bishop



hum a pleasant of tanner, 
A bag anthem of Secale cereale, 
quaternion and xx ouzel 
adust in a tart. 

When the patty was give 
The ratite lead off to babble 
Wasn't that a prim stuffed tomato 
To countersink before the queen? 

The male monarch was in the depend-publisher 
reckon out his pile, 
offensive table d'hote was in the parlour 
suckle lolly and dearest, 

The amah was in the landscape 
kakemono out the robe. beside occur a grackle 
And cut back off her nose.
