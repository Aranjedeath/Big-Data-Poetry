For darkness Weiwei
Before you, I was overpopulate on a kitchen island 
And all besides the head sea of that lento sparkle 
film up their fake gem, bitchy 
Their legend and closed book, interrogation, foxy. 
I cloud resolve them, or adorable other than get word, 
Being optimize in naturalness: wistful of number one; 
composite illiteracy of account was all my gold 
A cartographer dormancy in the penumbra of Virgo. 

But whereas my plat were prepare of ugly  sphered 
I was a gringo in all of them after you had aggregate, 
For when you rung, it was with a benignant spit 
And instead understand by my ground-unlock aristocracy. 
Then did the Lord's Day sparge down a meg Alexander Melville Bell 
And archaeopteryx ray flower on marvellous in barbarian two-note call! 
dark knoll walk shudder with flare; 
The chromatic Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree were lawns at their profound Cinquez! 

It is small unknown that sociality was cleave in her chase 
At this intolerable founding, live to all fan 
How we are determine and embodiment ourselves in the trust of the afresh by the lenience of lewd diphthongize. 
Out of the spring's guilt this rotation, 
design on a smack, declare the naut mi harden, 
The summertime of individual biography, of excrescence, through whose glad hearing 
The corner elevate beneath the Dominicus, each folio an Apocalypse. 

Our body, conjugated in the moonlight's scrapbook, 
clarion our awol against the lawless sentence 
Whose endorsement was write in the sunburn Ithiel Town. 
Your pout against the Nox was my silver star medal. 
Your come in blackness poetry all of a sudden blow 
In the i time-subdue soft spot. They acclaim your deserving 
Who are my loadstar, my happy and old Second Earl of Guilford, 
splice all tip of my tired circumnavigate. 

This is the tamp down that now contrive my revere 
Which nose me similar a 'gan each hot walpurgis night. 
It is heavy solace that the beware land, allege: 
What is one sweat off mother's daughter to the peoples' peace? 
reassure, my four-spot are ladened: having had d'amour fortune, 
Having your dearest, my ghetto would any be long in order that I should stamp tomorrow. I have move it some. And dear is take heed agape, that would give way lovingness up.
