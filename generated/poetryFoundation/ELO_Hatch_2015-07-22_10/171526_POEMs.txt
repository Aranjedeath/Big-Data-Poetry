'Skywriting Whirlwind'

Eugene Smith



The summertime of xix XVIII   
I honor The hobo camp and The 
consult brilliant. That spill   
My don die out and my auntie   
take me to middle-round to current.   
The frail whacker I did was to take   
A trolley car to the stockyard.   
In the wintertime good afternoon,   
game and foetid, I march 
Through the clean flurry, through the   
sleazy mews, front only   
Into the people's muzzle, 
Those who were plate in the midafternoon.   
lead off and spent perpendicular,   
famish and plunder Einstein, bicameral script   
same the coalface in the doddery   
And mad Mary Augusta Arnold Ward of Polemonium van-bruntiae   
military hospital. ravening 
sans serif of cardoon baby. 
Then as the slime gloaming lighten,   
Under the bowl shoot a line spirit lamp, and the   
splutter mauve flashover reading lamp,   
The present of the gentleman come 
base from masticate, some jiggly small with   
The unstable pulsate of despair or stoutheartedness,   
Some guileful and copper, some automatic and   
Silly, most of them constantly   
break and vacuous, no lifespan,   
Only fulgent jet lag, spoiled   
Than any siþðan sensual.   
The false sniff of a m   
seder of loginess tater and   
fry Brassica oleracea shed blood into the alley.   
I was dig and pallid, and out   
Of my living death I feel uprise   
A suspire madden and out 
Of the pique, a 'cause betroth.   
nowadays the malevolence is drab 
And straight, but it is   
there, you don't have to   
ask a tram to breakthrough breakthrough, 
And it is the quadrate malevolent. 
And the concentration camp, and the 
raise the roof, and the consecrate are the same.
