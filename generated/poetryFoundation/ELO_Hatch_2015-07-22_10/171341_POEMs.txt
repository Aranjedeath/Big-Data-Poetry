In the unassisted have it beside in Wonderland's undermine, 
mirror headlamp blindly skid the fence in,   
carpenter sledgehammer under the flimsy dialog box,   
confidential information mothy the foreground frontal all day cheere,   
A pass off of sound truck agonistic rising, craunch,   
Their freightage shroud, as chronic. 
The roof lighten up scarcely, the pitch plot   
slide perpetually onward. onward
onward                            earreach the milkman's chop up,   
His pains up the step, the bottle's tink,   
I revolt from go to sopor, light up a coffin nail, 
And prowl to the transom. The bouldery mews   
model the motion in which channelize repulsion,   
The street-lamp's listening watch and the horse's longanimity.   
The wintertime sky's alabaster Das Kapital 
plough me thoughtlessly to seam with splendid heart. 

eccentricity uprise in the still aura. The unpackaged   
scum grey. joggle beach wagon, hooves' cascade,   
fathom near off, build up, trashy and dear.   
A stanley steamer hack, jumpstart. forenoon, small   
fade the vent, airlift the whole-incubate chaise longue   
From underseas, ignited the front-snifter,   
discern the lowboy and the white surround.   
The dame call in unitedly, sing, call off,   
foam and sing, sing! complexify, already dry   
With sleep, tender, athirst and moth-eaten. moth-eaten, moth-eaten,   
moth-eaten mother's boy of valet de chambre, the unknowledgeable Nox, the grind   
Of gratifying first light, the whodunit of emergence   
Again and possibly, possibly
possibly                         while historical document is unforgiven.
