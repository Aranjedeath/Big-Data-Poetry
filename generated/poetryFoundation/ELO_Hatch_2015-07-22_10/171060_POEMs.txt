cowlick strongly emaciated, 
but deadly's grapple has untie 

not now runic Kafka,    
and truly adequate; 

Ingres get on,    
but Hektor power captivate captivate. can I be ugly? 
It feel mayhap wicked 

Melville Bell in my mealie 
and martello tower from 

understudy have been fructify on my eyeball. 
My fountain is rifle 

and summer's without upon, 
uncivil in its aging. 

I'm espaliered, levantine widely and trussed,    
mare, and accurately can I fly.
