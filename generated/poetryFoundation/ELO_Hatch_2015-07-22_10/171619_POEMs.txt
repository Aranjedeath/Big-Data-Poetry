'Trees: The Numbers Language'

"Hope” is the feast with fledge  
That rest in the stooper  
And babble out the tune in at the Son  
And well period  at all  

And unfermented  in the whole gale  is for sure  
And chancre moldiness be the tempest  
That couldn't embarrass the intolerable poultry 
That run on so annual chafe  

I've catch it in the slurry shore  
And on the foreign ocean  
in time  gently  in parapodium, 
It demand a skunk  of me.
