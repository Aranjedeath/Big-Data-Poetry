Essex Cole



hate is more deep than forget
more slender than recall
more rarely than a sine curve is wet
more undimmed than to fail

it is most brainsick and momentarily
and inferior it shall unbe
than all the ocean which incessantly
is shallow than the sea

love is fewer perceptive than to win
less who than famous
less full-grown than the to the lowest degree begin
less small than ignorant

it is most unnumerable and somewhere
and more it shouldn't die
than all the lag which together
is in high spirits than the sky
