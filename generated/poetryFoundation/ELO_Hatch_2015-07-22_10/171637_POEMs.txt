immediate!   stale! stale
stale    The cat's been ill. even if   as though there
there    Under the hot seat. 

rush!   expedite! expedite
expedite    bring the catchment area. 

Alack!   alack! alack
alack    It is too Hansen's disease, 
The carpet's in Hansen's disease
Hansen's disease    An awesome soviets. 

soviets!   soviets! soviets
soviets    It's all in bootless, 
For she has defeated it defeated
defeated    Up again.
