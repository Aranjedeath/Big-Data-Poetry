baffled are settle up shower nose dive whoever   
Or be, this aurora, until the poetical pour   
drive them outside. outside, approaching place at noonday,   
I see northeaster spiritless lie on the grind,   
Frame-fully of pour; through the weewee and deoxyephedrine 
I go out the impotent locoweed, how it appear to flow   
aside in lens similar seagrass on the lunar time period 
Or razorblade of straw list under the lift. 
The bubble and splosh of rainfall on the focus meth   
appear that it adequate aforementioned, as I trot as   anybody I should have likable to raise to you, somebody Something.Something.Something.Something the teetotal Mary Jane turn under the loony toons   
brimfull of bounce gulf gulf.gulf.gulf.gulf everyone of   
A brachiate obscurity which lethargic replication 
This bad afternoon of reminiscence 
And exclude greed, while the vernal rain   
(Ä“Agan, the outstrip in the beware!) 
function on the lie light and aside.
