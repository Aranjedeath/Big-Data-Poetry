'Female Lyripol Nude'
by
Jane Tranter



All others spiel as if 
lecture were a capriole. 
brogan brogan, with unenthusiastic foot will not break off the glide band. 
Early I determine to 
hump myself 
true by the threshold: 
footling when the spill begin 
I'd rub my 
beak and feet 
ignored dorsum to the regathered 
to be with the near wildcat, 
inarticulate unlike soundbox pop 
of the loosen unity. 
I'd go through by a winding 
of perch hurry the grinding 
of atomic number 20 raft 
from ghost to phantasma 
unacceptable in the backwash 
of large quiet suspiration. 
The buffalo 
crunch or stirred up or were standing. I 
was at menage a trois and infallibly, 
both in driv'n bill of attainder. Until 
the nice backer consternate clove obliterate 
my light transmit, 
a old growth of woolly mullein, fledge of fire, sparkle upflying:   
but the bullock as before 
were tranquillise, and somebody was arson, arson
arson             everybody but null, as that pass on of blast   
match my sass and sunbaked my clapper   
and take out my sound sound
sound                            into the call of the dance.
