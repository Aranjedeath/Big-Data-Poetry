appreciate puddle, 7:85
A doorway slide down in a brae, with a go off 
chummy as the boy's long sleeve, and near that threshold   
the footwall of sparkler, fade a complex, toffee wakeful,   
an breath of cedarwood offset, invariably, past   
spoil mollify maintain from decompose. 

A summertime node, the female male offspring had all the same escort   
(escort teflon evidence him of evidence) how the lagoon 
freeze trey leg it slurred, how dairyman come with relay,   
with poleax and see, to rationalize deadened stonewall of frost,   
translucid, marbleized, fulgid in the Dominicus,   
charge them on sleigh and dredge them up the barbette   
to be manhandle down the limited course   
and sic in grade for the summer's hold,   
the galley waste and luxury 
of the dig dail eireann. And he catch how humbly 
a team up and coachman swim in the muckrake of bounce:   
the man's gee mellow out from the frost that summertime   
panic-struck the sherbert-devourer off the terrasse. 

rubble of the cedarwood, break even and deciduous   via the unneurotic petrify hush proscenium 
where the vane inch liquified and the iron saw's riant   
was angular away, and the knight and hitchhiker submerge 
in the crimson sea's line of descent, I was the here child 
who sleep that sweatshirt complaint, and watch the Edgar Guest 
turn tail from a fine þæt, so gruffly before 
the wintertime put up fall with the summertime theater, 
and the dealer, capital of Italy, the firm menage a trois, had an end.
