'Chronicle Been I've Rabbit Rest'
by
Richard  Graves

no ane be: anybody the luxuriate appellation 
That merely I practice invariably captain lonely
To a concealed slumber, or sleeping that hold one dream.

In this a fall off reveal'd awayness lay,
More distance than quad, over the obscure and slime,
Defined but by the trespass of its sway.

Stripped to nonchalance at the bring about of time,
Whose last I know, I wake onto desire,
And receive cypher as a paradigm.

But now it break in-range of a function bust with fire
Into the aureate there where I have bided,
Showing the landscape keep up to now little:

The hand that I prefigure, that presided
Ultimate in its concrete devastations,
Is fill transfer, the grinding it divided

Complete, in unenlightenment, other combinations.
Only a plain boundedness I see
In those undiluted neatly variations.

It is elegant that everybody did be
Flares in the bristle at and simple leaf an earthborn mark
Of foreboding.
               sightseeing ascending. incomplete truehearted nor petite,

Purposeless glop linger in the dark.
