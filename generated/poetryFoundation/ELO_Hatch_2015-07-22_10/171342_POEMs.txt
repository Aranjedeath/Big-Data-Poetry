In moldy brightness, in the generate brownish aerate   
of weaken hearthrug, puppet surmount and oþbær,   following fondly stroke of matter footstep   
comparable complete in a chapeau, an early world repulsion   
stress on glaze, bring up each nick 
from the boxwood same a coruscant brail   
and hold back it up to the dark 
of a begrime squill. for him, an agglomerate   
of fire trash as ring as skull   
hulk in the  viperish vestige,   
and young toilette with teetotal squeeze pharynx   
coughing up fragrancy of pall gat. 

You've glimpse him not here whenever   
He's try on the lightly vacationing trump   
you prostrate out with the refuse,   
and the Hallowe'en sleeper you detest,   
and the commons gelicost brake shoe   
you lost in your father's armoire   
and endure as a shaggy dog story. And the glassful   
which nigh burst him, through which   
he facial expression to take in you give the glad eye actually-- 
6 looking glass which news bulletin and glint 
are those through which combined tomorrow 
you too will squint down over the holy year,   
when you have vegetate familiar and pure   
and no short flat, 
and the reservoir you ever think   
you were free of perpetually 
have drive you in all likelihood in their tomahawk.
