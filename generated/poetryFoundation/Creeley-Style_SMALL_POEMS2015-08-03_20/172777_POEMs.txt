[A generated-poem based upon: 'Beowulf (Old English version)' by Anonymous]

void wide true
 mare torn
 ware helm song mine cyme
 dull hold
 hate word scan pale fife wean dome sang
 flat
 lust live hair wife fame dear soul
 mode
 lifes
 brim leas rices self
 love lean free
 bold gang tall wile gold byre
 cave
