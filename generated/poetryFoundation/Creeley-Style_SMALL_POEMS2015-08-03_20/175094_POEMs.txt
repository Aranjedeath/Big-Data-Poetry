[A generated-poem based upon: 'Greenlandâ€™s Icy Mountains' by Knight of the White Elephant of Burmah William McGonagall]

safe crags soft gazes cries sights tops busy
 rents oral wild
 peaks pour gaze ring
 looks fills hand boats whales time pass brooks dead fill land hearts fields read hear feel
 cold
